Into day 6 with no broadband connection,"Broadband went down 20th/21st December.  Reported early 21st.  Promise to fix by end of 24th.  Lots of calls from me to get an update as no communication or online tracking update at all.  Finally told that an engineer had picked it up on 24th and to no surprise whatsoever it still isn't fixed.  Really helpful change of date fix estimate to 28th though - that is by text and the online tracker still says it will be fixed by 24th.  It is now 26th.It would also be great if you change your customer service line that Openreach is a separate company and therefore you cannot get an update on progress. Looks like it is a wholly owned subsidiary to me and even if it wasn't my contract is with BT and not currently being fulfilled, so I'm not really interested in your corporate structure.",Richard,2021,12,26,1,0.075,0.088,Positive

A communication company....that can't communicate?,"A quick mention to the very beginning of my customer with BT. I ordered an internet package online and was given a date for activation. The date came and went and nothing was heard from BT. I chased them to discover that my order had been cancelled - they accused me of cancelling it. Strange. They re-ordered the order. Eventually...I had internet access. Woohoo. Some time later BT contact me and explain that their fibre service is now available in my area and that to upgrade to their 150mb package it would only cost a coupel of £ more. Sounds good to me so I tell them to go ahead. This is the beginning of November. I get numerous texts saying my engineer is coming on a certain date. The date comes and goes and unsurprisingly no engineer. I chase again. I'm told the date was provisional and not confirmed. They apologise for the 17 text messages that all explicitly confirm the date and time. I'm told I will be called back with an update in a day. No call. What a shock. I chase again. A helpful lady tells me the account is a total mess (No way?!) and she would dig through it. She says she will contact me with updates. SHE DOES! A genuine surprise. The update says the engineer will be coming on a set date and time. The day was 2 days ago. I've still heard nothing. I actually checked the order tracker the evening before and noted that the details say ""The appointment failed"". BEFORE THE ACTUAL DATE!?I'm now seeing on the tracker that the intended date to turn on my internet on is the end of MAY. Still no one has contacted me via telephone, text  or email to alert me to this. This is some of the poorest customer service I have ever received. How is it that ISP all seem to operate this poorly?If you're already a BT customer - I'm sorry. I'm in this boat with you.If you're not already a BT customer I would heed warning and look elsewhere. (And on a side note - the router (hub) they use is reasonably good. However it absolutely hates the PS4, even other Ethernet.)I'll return and update if they do ever bother to contact me. - I'm sure they'll reply with this with a standardised response of 'please contact our helpdesk' or 'visit this web page'. I can assure you all that these options have already been visited.",Chris,2021,12,24,2,0.085,0.061,Negative
Our landline was recently cut-off by BT…,"Our landline was recently cut-off by BT to force us to use the hub, into which we had to connect the house phones.Firstly, we have numerous power-cuts in this area and the landline would continue to work, whereas the same phones connected to the hub won't.Secondly, the internet is poor where we live and it often disconnects while being used and BBC iplayer often can't keep up.Thirdly, the cable which connects the landline phones to the wall socket wouldn't reach the hub which necessitated me buying a cable. Connecting the landline to the hub has not worked however.BT has provided 2 radio phones but these are not as good as the original 4 house phones and the many contacts are not automatically transferred making it a real pain for my 92yo mother who only uses the house phones. We didn't ask for this change and had no choice, it was imposed upon us and in my view constitutes a 'breach of contract' since we have now been unable to use our expensive house phones for more than a month.",G.

"Broadband doesnt work, engineers missing appointments","Ordered broadband for the 13th of december. Didnt on that day, waited for the next day still didnt work. Called BT they scheduled egineer, he didnt show up. I had left work early, lost my weekly bonus,regular wages and he didnt even show up. Called again scheduled another visit DIDNT SHOW UP AGAIN. Third time I called and thats when they finally showed up, had to leave work early 3 times and even then they couldnt fix the problem. They scheduled another appointment 4th time and they DIDNT SHOW UP AGAIN. What is wrong with this company wasting people's time and money absolutely ridiculous. Now its been 11 days and my broad band doesnt work next appointment is on 30th so that will be 17 day without the internet. Ludicrous stay clear of BT dont buy their services because if you have a problem good luck getting it fixedEdit: looks like BT wants me to write on community forums, but what will that even do people there aren't BT employees just members of community.",Vytautas Raginskas,2021,12,24,1,0.048,0.069,Positive
All year round I am happy BUT ..,"All year round I am happy BUT ..The moment I have to cancel the broadband as I plan to leave the country all the issues crop up. I had filled two cutomer service complaints within the span of a week and I am not just a disgruntled customer out to tarnish the name of the company. I initially planned to end my broadband plan on 10th Dec & agreed this over the phone with BT. However, my flight was a week after and so I call BT one month ahead in early November to pushed the final date for broadband to 18th Dec instead. A relatively simple thing to do, but everytime I called I was put on hold for 20minutes and told there was system issues.So i was asked to call tomorrow or next week or end of the month. I did everything as instructed and finally the customer service person assured me that the end date has been updated on the system. Come the 10th December, with extreme disappointment I find my broadband line was cut and this is a day right after Boris Johnson's announces ""Everyone should work from home , if you can"". So i ring the customer service number expressing my discontent and a very helpful man by the name of Finn (Glasgow Value Team) sorts the issue out with a refund and an immediate arragement for a 4G hub to arrive the next day at free of cost. HOWEVER, I was told that I need to call to confirm my end date for that 4G Hub as soon as possible to avoid entering into a new contract arragement. This is where I had a real issue, I called on Monday 13th to cancel the 4G hub for the 18th December and the other person on the line acknowledges that she understood the 4G cancellation is to happen on 18th Dec. On the 14th Dec,  I woke up to a nasty surprise of there being NO WIFI Again. At this point my patience is wearing thin and I have allot going on personally that the lack of internet connection is proving to be a MAJOR inconvience. I pick up the phone to speak to customer service again and I explain my situation repeatedly to 4/5 different individuals all of which do very little to solve my problem but pass the bucket to another clueless individual. Now imagine this, they keep asking me is there a reason I am leaving BT and if I would be interested in a different product. I said this time and again that I WONT BE IN THE COUNTRY & WILL HAVE NO USE OF ANY BT product.I mean the audacity to squeeze in Marketing and after that sternly warn me that if I dont cancel the plan on time I may face extra charges is both beyond infuriating. They have recorded all my telephone conversations for ""training purposes"" and everything in on record to show my phone call on 14th December was over 1 hour long! I got provided some temporary BT Wifi pass and was told another BT 4G hub will arrive the next day (although mind you the next day delivery was only provided to me after much insistance as they were only prepared to send me a Hub in the next 3-4 working days at the start of the call. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS & UNACCEPTABLE when it was NOT MY FAULT) . In conclusion, I would highly advise BT team to re-train your customer service in how to deal with leaving customer because my experience is absolutely appaling to say the least and I would never recommend BT or take up any BT products in the future as I have very little faith in their staff to understand the very very simple needs of customers. I am never the sort of person to lose my patience easily and I give people allot of chances before I write them off. But this experience is quite simply THE WORST.",Shivani Chakravarty,2021,12,23,1,0.11,0.058,Negative

Cherry on the cake is their invoicing – watch out for false and hidden charges. Upon further investigation (hold your breath) we discovered more than £2,000 false charges! Numerous complaints filed since and still ongoing. Zero duty of care to customers.

BT.... TERRIBLE SERVICE!,"Terrible service from BT. I had a speed issue last week and an Open Reach engineer was sent out. He said my socket had gone so replaced it. My speeds had dropped from the usual 65+Mbps to 48Mbps. I made numerous speed tests after he left  and was pleased to see 73Mbps for a day or so then it began to decrease, day by day. I'm now getting around 48Mbps again! I contacted them and a chap phoned back to say that as long as I'm not getting under 44Mbps then it's contractually correct and within their parameters. He factory reset my hub remotely and I now have to reset all my devices. Speeds still 48. They are going to send me out a new hub which will supposedly fix the issue. I doubt that very much. If speeds don't get back to normal soon I'm going elsewhere for my broadband!! It appears that BT are adamant they want me to receive the bare minimum speed they can get away with. There's a brand new housing estate just built down the road from me. I suggest that BT want to drop my speeds to enable sufficient bandwidth for the new homes. There are plenty of other ISP's out there! Very disappointed. Speeds have been great for several years...... So why the sudden drop? Improve my speeds ASAP BT or take a hike!!!!!",Chris,2021,12,23,1,0.056,0.062,Positive

The five stars are for Fiona in…,The five stars are for Fiona in Belfast.If you need any technical help she is an angel oracle or both. I phoned BT a few days ago  my hub would not connect WiFi to some devices and none in certain areas of my home.I waited 30 minutes got cut off twice.Spoke to someone who raised and closed that as a complaint telling me I may not have been hung up the system cuts calls off and puts another through?? Really what?? Took them so long to go through that then tell me I need to speak to another team about faults I gave up.Tried again spoke to a Lee who tried to sell me a new package with disks ..then a Roberta in Belfast who told me ah yes TP hub just use your MYBT log in ..now no connection at all!!!I knew she didn't have a clue but now from bad to worse.Phoned back got Noel ..again in Belfast.He was completely out of his depth kept repeating himself sounded on another planet and as if he was trying to bore me to death to end the call.Finally he said he would have someone call me it was too complex for him!Ready to raise the roof I got a call from Fiona in yet again Belfast.She was not put off by my seemly complex prroblem.In fact was full of glee and straight off the bat after confirming what was going on asked me about my ethernet cable and PPPOE.Bingo! We are now connected everything working she also gave me top tips for my Sky Glass and Sonas which my own Tech guy was at a loss for.So went from no connection due to Roberta not knowing what she was doing to Noel clearly making me feel guilty for phoning to finally getting the astounding Fiona and now a happy customer.Christmas saved and I can work from home.Yes it was a non BT router but advisor fudging resulted in no broadband that is very much a BT issue hence a minus ten for Roberta  plus a minus ten for Noel which was a horrible and painfull call.BT how many times do you have to call before you get someone who knows what they are doing?We are staying with BT purely due to Fiona being so brilliant.Please ensure she gets some praise.She saved you a customer hope you get her a bottle of something nice BTModaraters Let me know if you would like my BT account number to verify,Chris Piano Guy,2021,12,22,5,0.086,0.114,Positive
A loyal customer let down,Moved house and was told everything would be up and running for the 27th November . Order got cancelled by bt (told computer glitch) new connection date 14th December . Told pack of lies about not loosing my space in the fiber cabinet. Lost space in fiber cabinet. Bt told me nothing they could do and advised to go to another provider to see if they had fiber available. Pretty poor service for a company that I have been with for nearly 10 years and told to check daily to see if any slots open up in the cabinet when I only moved one Street away and was being connected to the same fiber cabinet. Would I recommend bt ? Straight answer no. Seem to be happy to lie and dodge questions. Sick of phoning them constantly to be told different lies on what they could do to sort the issue. Now stuck with copper broadband and can't use it for work🤬Oh and a side note they don't answer the Twitter account or contact you when they know they are in the wrong and have messed up.,Darren logan,2021,12,22,1,0.129,0.056,Negative
Fantastic Fibre Broadband service,I'll start off saying its been several years since I have been with BT for broadband services. I have recently signed up to their full fibre servicePreviously been with Sky and Plusnet which worked through the Openreach network anyway. No issues for several years on lesser products however.I am now into my 3rd month on their 150mbps package and it has been a top quality service. Proving to be consistently delivering the speeds promised at the point of sale and the WiFi connection internally has had no issues whatsoeverYou want a high quality service for full fibre? BT will give it to you. That's my experience,Brendan Duffy,2021,12,22,5,0.041,0.052,Positive
Terrible Service,"So the recent storm brought down the post supplying our landline. Living in a rural location with poor mobile signal at best, I reported the problem from the car, a mile away from home. The call handler was not interested in the problem, just dispatching an engineer. Told here this was a waste of time and the pole had snapped. She eventually understood but sent a man in a van to tell me he couldn't help and would put an action plan in place. Two weeks later a chat with Bombay Telecom, sorry pun intended, told me it had been fixed and to rush home from a mile away. Nope, not fixed. A chat to New Dehli the next day, in the freezing cold, to an advisor that was adamant it was fixed, the engineer says so! Looking at my snapped pole at the time and not happy. Even ""the supervisor, Vickie ( really!) didn't achieve any satisfaction and was then told the fault was probably in my house and I would be charged £85 if it was found my pet or Building work had caused it! Complaint raised, but obviously, no way of be contacted! A call to Solihull followed, and although the guy at least understands English, the earliest fix date was another 9 days. Xmas, oh dear cancelled due to no Internet, calls, mobile, signal or covid!!! Yeah it is my choice to live rural, but I am only half a mile from the A1!

Also got charged a connection fee but I rang up when they had an offer on where there was no connection fee, to be fair I did get that reimbursed, but still not happy I got charged for a full month when I wasn't connected for a couple of weeks. They tried to blame the connection in the area but there's plenty of our neighbors have internet and they said there was never a problem getting connected, so really don't know what the issue was or if it was just laziness by the engineer.",Gemma Raine,2021,12,22,1,0.064,0.087,Positive

We joined BT in Jan 2021, and, to be fair, some initial speed issues were sorted in good time... then I (account holder) received a call 10 months later to advise me to upgrade to Halo 3 - and I agreed to it.Speed promise: - with a verbal and tv campaign promise of no less than 60mb download speed, including unlimited call-outs etc, etc, etc, I can testify that after 2 engineer call outs and them trying to resolve our speed problem, I have now learned that that the speed guarantee is only to your home, not from your router to devices - please take note: we live in a regular council house and cannot get speeds beyond 40mb, (and often see speeds so low as 12-16mb - honestly)I have contacted customer services to REPEAT over what slow speeds we are experiencing, and in my latest call I was told that what I am getting is ''good enough to be fair''... what???I requested that we be returned to our old tariff due to not getting aby moe value for money - and I was advised that a revert-to-previous contract (words to that effect) was not possible as the cool-off period had elapsed. I complained that during the 'coolong off period'' I was advised by engineers who came to our house, to wait 4-5 days to see if the speed problems are resolved after their intervention. Ultimately, despite my mild-mannered protestations, and suggestion that I may seek legal advice, I suspect that many unhappy paying customers, like me, will have to see out the contract...I thought I would have faith in a BT productI truly regret joining BT for the issues we are experiencing, and hope others do not have the sameI invite BT to respond with my review and the information they have on our calls, so that readers can see for themselves.:-( :-(:-(",G Wilks,2021,12,22,1,0.067,0.114,Positive

I live in a 3 bedroom house yet I’ve been charged for 15 devices! This has been going on since September. 3 calls and told the same thing “yes we’ve removed that error and you won’t be charged we are very sorry” £80 taken from my account because BT “forgot” to authorise initial direct debit. Currently on hold for the 4th time. An hour later and cut off due to politely asking for the transcripts of the calls with me repeatedly asking if this 15 device thing had been removed. Can not believe such a big company can get away with this. Training requirements are much needed along with transparency!

Everday they would text me saying it was ok to apply now and without my consent would then run more credit checks!!!!!! BT have now asked me to carry on with my order and pay my up front fee. They must be joking!!!!!!I'd love to be with BT but not at the expense of me building up my credit score.For a company this big their attitude towards potential customers is disgusting!

Got every single interaction with me wrong.,"I was with BT for 5 years. Initially, things were ok, but then one day, I can't even remember why, I called them up for an issue. On the call, they explained that they could halve my broadband bill, and it would be no cost to me. Great! Confusingly, an engineer turned up the following week. He couldn't really work out what was going on, and nor could I, but he had a look and left.Turned out his job had been to install a 'second' broadband line. Why would anyone want that. So rather than paying half, I was paying double. OBVIOUSLY this wasn't something I'd asked for, nor could it 'possibly' have been a misunderstanding. Sorting this out was not quick. At all. Customer service were immediately understanding, from the word go, apologetic. And yet it still took forever.We then had to temporarily (9 months) move house, and took the broadband with us. During the move, we were given a mini hub, which was vital because we didn't actually get broadband for a while, and even then the engineer had to be a bit shifty, because there wasn't actually any BT infrastructure, it shouldn't really have been sold to us. Moving back, we were told our old property, that we'd been in for 4 years with BT, could not have BT broadband installed. They thought maybe installing a phone line might change that on their system so that was booked in, and a second mini hub was sent out. (Because the first one wouldn't work?) The mini hub didn't work. I called, and was told ""Yeah, it wouldn't, because your move has already happened"". Sort of defeating the purpose. Was told she'd send out another one, but this proved to be a lie when I called again 2 days later, and finally, a third (!?) mini hub was sent out. This ALSO didn't work, but at this point it had been 48 hours since getting our phone line, so figured I could just phone to get our broadband back up, since I was already paying for it.Thankfully, somehow along the way, unbeknownst to me, my broadband contract had actually been cancelled (which is possibly why the third mini hub also didn't work, so much for 'always on'). Pretty opportune moment to change providers, I feel.The vibe I get is that the customer service reps just don't actually have enough power, or are crippled by inefficient systems and red tape. The things they say, and attitudes are always great, but then the actions, the physical outcomes of calls with them is ALWAYS universally terrible.",Richard,2021,12,20,1,0.044,0.058,Positive

"Internet installed in wrong flat, 2 months wait until internet access will be possible","Was with BT for 2 years, and thought I would take out a fresh contract for 70mb DL speeds in a new flat I was moving to. The date provided was great, as the engineer would attend and do the installation before I move in, so would be a smooth transition. I get a text saying the engineer doesn't need to come and that the internet would be up and running, great. However, the internet isn't working so they send me a new hub and splitter, 2 days Royal Mail fail to deliver. So I call Royal Mail and they inform me that they do not have my correct address. So I call BT and it turns out they have started the contract and completed the installation at the wrong flat.Moving forward, I feel I have been on the lowest priority list possible. I had to wait 1 full month for the engineer to turn the internet on, however this was turned on a 0.5mb download speed - I now need to wait until January 5th to turn the internet onto the correct speed. At the moment, the internet is completely unusable for how slow it is, so I can't use it for work, so I have the joy of commuting to work in the cold, coronavirus ridden underground.I've been told I would be compensated fairly, so I'm assuming they will follow Ofcom ruling. Either way, 2 months to get online is disgraceful, and emailing me my bill crisply on time is the cherry on top.",James Smith,2021,12,19,1,0.037,0.066,Positive
100% failure to install fibre,"I started back in the summer to get fibre 900 installed but as usual B.T cocked this up. First the adviser said I didn't need to be in when the engineer came but low and behold he needed access to my house to install a box. I complained to a team leader then they arranged another visit to which open reach moved the date without informing me. So rearranged it again and the they just didn't turn up. So that was the last straw and I cancelled the order. So black Friday deals come and thought I would try again ( big mistake). First the engineer was spot on and fitted everything but I received a fault after he left. I phoned B.T technical team and they said that I was getting switched on later that day but i informed them that I had the internet working but it was a fault, he told me its fine and that it would be fine when i get switched on so i waited a few hours and yes you guessed it the fault was still there. They could of get the engineer back but the advisor thought he knew more than me.  I spoke to someone who was on the technical team and they confirmed what I told them. So another engineer was booked in for the following day 1300hrs to 1800hrs. THE OPEN REACH LAZY IDIOT DIDNT EVEN SHOW UP. So B.T are absolutely useless and should be fined for treating customers like this. VOLO13-642392605778 TO PROVE THAT ITS ONGOING. SORT YOUR COMPANY OUT, DON'T EVER GO WITH B.TREPLY TO B.

Absolute disgrace,"Absolute disgrace! Can’t wait until my contact is up and I can move elsewhere! Nothing but problems with BT from installation to providing a reliable service. Went moths without a constant service recently and was sent out a mini hub eventually after constantly complaining that the internet was knocking off for 10-50 minutes all day everyday. I still paid my bill for this shoddy service (never experienced this with sky, had to move to BT as they and virgin at the time were the only ones supplying fibre direct into the home) anyway due to a bill error they cut me off on Friday for a £17.10 underpayment ( I wasn’t aware of this underpayment as it wasn’t mentioned on my bill) no warning at all. They have absolutely no loyalty to their customers if they did they would have told me I could claim money off my bill during the months of constant poor or no service (found this out later) we are faceless numbers to them.",Janis,2021,12,19,1,0.142,0.045,Negative
So on the 7th or 8th December 2021 I…,So on the 7th or 8th December 2021 I was once concerned about a Mc AFee Anti Virus message that kept popping up on the screen and I tried ringing an IT repairs company in York after I had rang a few of these IT repairs companies one of them had recommended too get in touch with your phone and Broadband provider BT and so I did I explained the issue and this sweet lady who works in BT technical department was so helpful when talking me through what to do when ridding your laptop of a message that is now serving no use and rather hoped this dear lady who worked at BT could help me and talk me through how to replace the free Mc Afee Anti Virus and this I did not go through. But this not where my problem started it was when I decided on that same night too contact by ringing 0800 800 150 and choosing option 3.I asked about the iPhone11 and was not too happy as I had made calls to Apple the company who are very good in general but did let me down as I explained the issue I had with once creating a password with included username too sign up with apple.So I can use the Apple App as this was successful for a while and had put all identical details created and had I assumed was using the correct signing in detail that did work for a short while and now I can not sign in all this I told the BT mobile team and then they made a suggestion.Why don’t we put you on a new Mobile phone deal “ Oh right I said I then asked can I send my old Iphone11 that I had signed up for in December 2019 BT said “No” Right I said so I then asked the BT salesman what am I going to want with 3 phones.I want too send the phone that I am using back too BT if I am not going to use it or it will not be in use if BT had got a better deal and it will work better by far and I was talking and going through with the BT salesman all the phones on offer and the prices per Month I was disappointed with it all.I wanted to also enquire about the identical iPhone11 that is in my Father name and belongs to him and want to let them know that my Father was told by Halifax Online Banking that if you want an online Bank account then you will require a Mobile phone so I got on the lap top and went through all the mobile phones with BT and saw not much.So I called 0800 800 150 and pressed option 3 or the option too put me through too BT Mobile and discussed with the lady in December 2019 what my Father really wants a Mobile phone for and really enquired about a simple Sam but a very easy and simple using phone is not an ideal phone for receiving receiving text from Halifax but they did not really send many messages and Father really did not know how to use the IPhone11 and there was really no point having this phone but Father still has it and do not use it and I once took it out with me when I had taken Fathers Bank Card and when I did not arrive back at the time I said then that was they only time Halifax sent a message to the phone that belongs too my Father.,Abigail Sims,2021,12,18,1,0.029,0.077,Positive
well my 88 year old Father has been…,well my 88 year old Father has been with BT for 39 years or from what I have worked out and BT was great in 1986 when he first joined them as there was no such thing as Broadband back then and BT was just for landline calls and bills for that particular charging.Father decided he would get Broadband in 1998 or sooner and maybe BT will know all this and there as far as Father was concerned no issues in that year.It wasn't until 2015 and I think BT may again help with dates and time Father wanted me too go out and purchase a lap top from Asda in Monks Cross too watch all his BT Sports on his TV with a HDMI cable this was the year when many problems had started with streaming the football as in the end when my Father was trying too watch it the picture turned into a lot of little tiny squares so you can not see the ball been kicked or the football player running around at that matter and so in the end  Father sort of ended it and did not want to carry on watching and streaming BT football in this way anymore because it was not so good as he would like it to be and somehow and do not know how my Father had found out that it would be best too enquire about a BT TV box too see how much better this service would and yes far better picture quality where some and not all BT football channels was in HD there is a few downfalls and Father would like to watch channels he can not get as the Broadband speed or BT TV box speed is not fast enough and BT can not change this offer as if Father doe's then it will no longer be a very good deal BT will have too make the price up for faster connection.I should of looked at Father's bill on his behalf and see what the price of the BT TV package was before agreeing another deal for a BT TV box as the BT sales man I believed him and so Father will want his old Box plugged back in as that was originally cheaper plus he had everything he wanted on it.,Peter Sims,2021,12,18,1,0.044,0.078,Positive

Was with BT a few years,Was with BT a few years. Although I have no complaints about customer service I dealt with on phone while with them and my initial set up & dates all went smoothly I have be honest  and say the Internet isn't great and the hubs conk out.. netflox would work on my TV from them but YouTube wouldn't it would just delay.. my Internet often cut out and would say Internet unavailble on my WiFi. The prices are to high and when they give u a offer  to lengthen contract and yoi agree they just up the amount not long after anyway so I lost free weekend calls to end up paying the same i felt so cheated.. I also not long back had a message asking me to upgrade to Fibre when I was already suppose to be on BT fibre it was right there in my plan but I knew they weren't giving me that anyway speeds were too slow. I was never made aware either I could've been using BT cloud to save stuff in all the years I was with them. I only seen this on a forum when I was looking at switching.  I also live in a cottage flat so my living space is upstairs but I have my own stairs leading down to my front door. Yet the WiFi would struggle or just not be connectable downstairs so thats a very poor signal. The WiFi should cover a whole house.  I see neighboughs WiFi signals reach my house but BT won't reach as far as bottom of stairs which was annoying when u want to chill in my front garden in summer etc. Its definitely not value for money. I've just recently switched it was switch to cheaper or I was just going to give up home Internet but since switching several days ago a BT rep has just been knocking at my door going on that they're upgrading area etc etc and questiong me about who I'm with now.. makes me wary theyd try sabotage lines or something.theyve also tried saying they want their box back but that came included Free in my package years ago so was paid for.

Shocking.,"We booked to move broadband on the 22nd Nov and was told we would get it 13th Dec. It was a while to wait as we were working from home, but we waited. 13th Dec comes and goes and no one bothered to show up. We called up to ask what was going on and apparently something went wrong with communication their side so the engineer never got the notification, or something. We were told to call up again 16th Dec (no idea why we had to wait and call back) and were promised we could get internet by Christmas Eve. Guess what? We called on 16th Dec and were told that was a lie, there was nothing they could do and we won't get internet til 5th January.

I honestly don’t know why they have so…,I honestly don’t know why they have so many bad reviews :/It’s not been my experience at all. I deal with them ok behalf of a grandparent and they’ve been super easy to deal with and helpful. It’s been a refreshing experience especially after leaving a certain well known company myself due to a list of issues. This other company called me 2-3 times a day after I left to offer me a “better deal” and tried to tell me my usage of the internet would mean I would get a lot of buffering if I left and went elsewhere. Which was rubbish and I’ve had little to no issues with the new company. ANYWAYEasy management of account online. Really Friendly and helpful man when I called up with an issue. Had no cues when waiting to speak to someone. Good price for what we need. And I can check his bills for him easily online.They don’t hound me with new offers or call me needlessly. Nor have they hiked up the price. Yes I would recommend.,Katie ,2021,12,14,5,0.04,0.19,Positive

I have had my telephone number for over 60 years and an organisation as big as BT can't seem to rectify their mistake.

DO NOT USE BT FOR BROADBAND,I work from home due to Covid and am MD of a company. My broadband stopped working for 2 days in May 21. They sent me a mini hub in the post and got it working again. The same happened in Sept 21. They sent an engineer round who did a test on the router and all his checks. Said it looks like a problem with the copper wire coming into the property that has gets damp periodically. Someone from BT will get back to me in 48 hrs telling me what they are going to do. I heard nothing. 3 weeks went by still nothing. I am therefore in a position when the broadband could go down again and this really affects my ability to work. I therefore took out broadband with another company that provides broadband with a different cabling system at a 300 meg speed. We are now 2 months down the line and I heard nothing from BT. I have given BT opportunities to resolve it but they failed. They have not delivered a consistent service. I called them today and they will not allow me to cancel without paying up for the remaining term of the contract which runs to 14 Oct 2022. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY (BT).

The mini hubs we were sent previously do not work. Nothing works so we have gone from having reliable but slow broadband to having no broadband at all when working from home. We have not been told what the problem is but that Openreach will try to fix by Monday. In the meantime I have a day long online meeting I will have to tether to my phone. Absolutely shocking.

Go with any other provider than BT,"BT is the perfect example of what happens when you give a company monopoly powers. They cease to care about their customers and offer an unrealiable, low quality service. When you contact their customer service you waste time going round and round in circles proving your identity, after which they usually try to palm you off by sending out some free hub, or connector, or even phone which doesn't resolve the issue. They contract out their engineer services so you if an engineer comes, they will only be able to deal with ""internal"" issues when the problem is almost always external (BT's lack of investment in the infrastructure). And after the engineer leaves you'll usually have a conflicting account where they claim the engineer reported all was well. We continually have issues with speed dropping and the solutions are always short term, after a few days or weeks it returns to the same.

Tried to get a 4g hub sent as our internet was down but was told it was not an eligible fault. Supposedly major service outages are not included in this offer, which if you think about it is totally useless. If your local exchange had a massive issue say a fire and hundreds of subscribers in the area were without service by definition this would not be included because its a major service outage, despite the fact it would be an ongoing issue for an extended period of time.At no point during upgrade over the phone was I told there were conditions attached to the offer of sending a 4g hub in the event of an issue. So I have been paying. a premium above the norm for 20 months now for a service which when needed I was refused.

Its supposed to be Fibre and 100% sorted. biggest joke. they said they would contact me once the hub has arrived to discuss compensation which we all know is rubbish as i was told this before then they closed my complaints so they didn't have to compensate.

Almost a calendar month of no service,"I recently moved home and decided to go with BT for my broadband (FTTP) and TV service. In mid-September 2021 my services were activated and all worked fine and I was really happy. On the 2nd of November my services stopped and have been off since. I have had 4 engineer visits to my property and several more working on the cabinet/lines outside. Someone at BT then decided a ""cease and re-provide"" was the best solution to my woes. The lead time was given and my services were meant to be switched on by 26th November! An engineer visited my property and after lengthy discussions with two external teams that deal with Open Reach (FND and another) the engineer was told they could not see my services as being ""live"", even after a change of ONT box. Further work was attempted on the outside cabinet and lines but to no avail. Every time they give me an ETA for repair they then tell me it has gone back to Open Reach and they will let me know ""next week"" (the lead times are always 5 working days apparently). And this is where I am up to. I am none the wiser as to how this has happened nor am I any closer to being given a resolution. Even the person dealing with the complaint has not called me back, despite a promise to call back on 29th November. Not sure if there are too many people within the organisation that don't know what they are doing or if there are issues communicating between Open Reach and BT but I have never experienced anything like this before and the lack of transparency is disgusting.

I recently installed BT's unbreakable…,"I recently installed BT's unbreakable wifi Halo package.BT's home tech expert is supposed to:1. Make sure your broadband connection is perfectly set up for you and your home. The home Tech removed my old router and connected the new one.2. If you've got Complete Wi-Fi, they’ll set it up, giving you guaranteed wi-fi in every room. BT's policy is to only send out one wifi disc with the router. THerefore, if you need 3 discs The Home Tech Expert cannot do their job properly. There is a tool on the My BT app to check the signal strength, but the Home Tech Expert didn't use it. The signal strength checker lacks discrimination as a measurement system because it only measures 4 levels. Measuring signal strength with an app you can get on your phone gives the measurement in dBm and this can give precise information when the signal starts to drop and where the discs need to be placed. Therefore, I don't understand why BT have this policy of only sending one disc out at a time when it can be determined, up front, how many discs are needed.3. Explain your security features and parental controls, helping protect you and your family. The Home Tech Expert made no attempt to do this. 4. Answer all your tech questions and show you how to use the My BT app. The Home Tech Expert made no attempt to do this.When I showed the Home Tech Expert the email from BT detailing what he was supposed to do I got no response. When I wrote a complaint email to BT, they closed the complaint without providing details of why they had closed it. When I phoned them up to find out what had been done they told me they had contacted the supplier to inform them of the complaint. No feedback was ever obtained.When the new Halo service was installed it was very unstable and the lights on the router indicated a problem with the service. These problems had always been there, but were not as bad with the old router. In fairness to BT they did send out two  Openreach engineers. The first engineer fixed two line faults, which reduced the faults but did not eliminate them. The second engineer fixed another line fault which the first engineer did not detect. I question why the first engineer did not detect all the faults. A simple ping test revealed timed out errors, and unstable connection on video calls is an indication there could still be line issues on the service providers side. Aren't BT supposed to monitor line drops. In fairness to BT I now have a system that works, but I would not rely on BT to fix any issues in the future because K don't value their customer service or technical service.

I said I am recording this call as at least evidence I have called them twice and proof I have done more than my part kept on hold for 1 hr . The BT rep said he could no longer help me because I was recording the call. I said ""so its ok for BT to record the calls but not for me to record the calls?"". He said yes. So I told him I would post his recording on Youtube for all to hear. Strange since all  I wanted to do is to be honest was to be  upfront that  I was recording and I do it for all calls by default for all my calls . He said it was BT policy to put the phone down on anyone who informs BT customer support they are recording the call. LOL  .

Quite an unprofessional policy to have and with the extremely arrogant tone he had, I was very polite but quite shocked at his attitude but maybe he was having a bad day . not surprising with the quantity of negative comments on Trustpilot  but I have found the actual Broadband service to be quite ok, other than a bizzar BT policy on customer recording a phone call . sadly I cannot post my YT link here.

BT Customer Service gets thumbs down,"Out of the frying pan....Reaching the end of my Virgin contract and looking to terminate asap (terrible Broadband performance and customer service is non existant)I contacted BT yesterday and purchased Broadband, to be activated today.This morning I received the equipment and set it up, called the activation team and they told me it will be next week because of Openreach...  and that I have an appointment for next week with Openreach! Its all in the T's & C's she said. When I expressed my disappointment she said ""What do you want me to say""!On top of this I cannot access my account on ""My BT"". When I try I just go to another account with none of my details.I called yesterday (Sheffield call centre) about this and was told that I won't be able to do this until my account has been activated by BT. I pointed out that the salesman had told me I should be able to access it shortly after receiving my confirmation email. When I told her this she said ""I'm not lying to you""!So when I spoke to the activation team (Dundee) this morning I gave them my new account number to bring up my details and she promised to text me details of how to get into my account. She sent me a text containing only the account number I gave to her at the beginning of the call.I rang back and I am now on hold whilst a lady in the activation team (Falkirk) is trying to work out what to do.Putting me through to someone on the email department.He is deleting my old account ID.... He has done this successfully using ""Admin Tool"" and now can only see my new account number. Instructed to log out and in again - I have done so but still showing old account number!!!So... I have spoke to 5 people, can't access my account,  have no internet and have spent about 90 minutes on the phone.I was moving from Virgin because they are dreadful.I was really hoping for better from BT!***Update 1 December 2021***Today is my activation day (well, my second one because the first one was immediately postponed) and I am waiting for Openreach.In the meantime I STILL cannot access my account and despite contacting ""nameless"" on Twitter absolutely nothing has been done about it and nobody has attempted to contact me.Come on BT. I need you to provide the service which you sold me, not the lack of service I am already suffering with Virgin Media.* Update 25/11/21 16.45I contacted Twitter and received an automated respone asking me to text various messages followed by my landline number.I DONT HAVE A LANDLINEAlternatively it suggests I log into ""My BT"" accountI CANT. IT HAS NOT BEEN SET UP CORRECTLY. THATS WHY I AM CONTACTING YOU!As you can see, I am wasting MORE time and am now considering just cancelling the contract. I am not sure I can stand 2 years of this nonsence.UPDATE 15/12/2021Everything is now working as it should    and the social media team helped achieve this. I feel that I spent far too long sorting out BTs issues and the initially sales call really should be listened to and analysed to avoid many of the issues I encountered.",Steve,2021,11,25,3,0.038,0.045,Positive

Disgusting Scammers,"So our household is paying a decent amount of money to have decent speed and its very rare to actually reach those speeds if you actually test your speed. With our previous deal at talk talk I would get the same speed in terms of Ping, download speed and upload speed at any time any day of the year. With BT its rare I ever get close to what we're paying for getting around a 1/30th of the speed we're paying for, for at least a couple hours a day. In this household there are people awake 24/7 and its honestly disgusting how they completely shut off the internet sometimes for tens of minutes at a time. We called to get support because their other methods of customer service are so painstakingly horrible all they do is tell you to restart your router and check if your device is in wifi range. Once we finally got on the phone after about an hour of waiting we explained to the troglodyte on the other side of the phone the situation they tried to say the same things like ""check your wifi range"" and we needed to explain that multiple PC's connected via ethernet at the same time were dropping speed at the same time and told them to do something about it. The idiot really told us to restart the router after swapping the router for a new one couple weeks ago. After his 2 line script of ""restart the router"" didn't work he went to the 2nd part of his training which was to shill ""better"" more expensive deals to us including their all new secondary ""4G router"" which was meant to be a backup for when the main one fails then I asked this incompetent worker how my ethernet only PC was going to connect to the 4G router he froze up and asked me to repeat the problem. Why does BT slow down my internet to a 1/30th of what I'm paying for? All in all, this company is a great massive scheme to sell you an awful service which doesn't work or works very poorly in order for you to go through hours of terrible support which gets you nowhere with the issue at hand and attempt to scam you into essentially paying more for another terrible expensive product which is going to ""fix"" your problem. Going back to talk talk soon I think its a little more expensive but we had them for 2 years and the internet only went out once (along with everyone's in the neighbourhood)",XERXXS,2021,11,23,1,0.053,0.03,Negative

Next Day Connection?  Still waiting 5 months on...,"Purchased Halo for Business on the 2nd July with next day connection, the date they are now proposing to install internal fixings – 9th December, 5 months later!!!  Appalling service from start to date. It started with our address which they took down incorrectly, but computer said ‘NO’ to updating that. Many calls and emails, months later, the address was changed so items started to turn up at our actual address. Then we had many Engineer visits, each one either could not or did not want to help until we found one that could although he was reluctant, preferring to work on a Saturday so he could be paid double time!  Logged a complaint but not sure how this helped as they just emailed saying they would update us on a future date or called once without leaving a voicemail or follow up email – box ticked but not helpful! We were supposed to have next day connection with the 4g Hybrid Hub, spent 2 hours on the phone trying to set it up as it would not connect, finally realised we had BT Hub 1 instead of 2. They sent out a BT Hub 2 although it turned out to be a BT Hub 1 again and now Computer says ‘NO’ to sending out a BT Hub 2 until we are connected. In the meantime, we cannot run our business properly and are losing man hours and money and have reputational damage due to this incompetency.In summary, if you are looking to get broadband and are happy to be connected in 5 months from purchase date, have loads of free time and love spending it on the phone to customer services who cannot help you then BT is perfect for you.  If you are looking for a company who follow through on what they advertise, do things in a timely fashion and are helpful, then, in our experience, BT is definitely NOT for you!",Ruth,2021,11,23,1,0.101,0.068,Negative

I’m sure this was in the small print but you may miss it when you are setting up with BT. They basically hold you hostage.

Once I called BT, they were only able to arrange for the engineer to come a whole week later. A few day after that I got a notification that this appointment had been moved a further two days without asking me, to a day when I was not free. I spoke again with someone in the home moved team who said that my appointment was moved back to the agreed day and assured me that it would not change. On the morning of that day I checked my account and it said my appointment was in fact in two days time. When I called BT there was a lot of confusion but someone assured me that the engineer was in fact coming that day, despite what it said on my account. You guessed it: the engineer didn’t show up. When I called after the appointment the advisor in the home moved team had no idea why I’d been told that the appointment was going ahead that day and said it was set for two days later. Since I was not free on that day, it had to be rearranged for a full week later.

"BT does not guarantee internet speeds, useless service is your only guarantee.","Had to come back and write a second review. 4 months of unresolved issues... the worst service I've ever received. BT do not guarantee WIFI speeds and at times my connection has been slow (0-10mbps download) and intermittent. If you're looking at connecting to WIFI using BT, they will not help you and you are not covered in your contract. The speed guarantee is via cable connection only. Speeds are just as unreliable when connected to ethernet cable. When you raise a complaint regarding your connection BT say they've run a speed test externally and it's fine. No help, no solutions.

Absolute fiasco of a company,"Absolute fiasco of a company, totally incompetent does not even begin to describe it. We have had a BT line since we moved into our new home just over 4 years ago but never used it, only had it because they supplied the broadband to our new build, we had no choice on provider. We have recently decided to go elsewhere to get a better deal and gave notice. BT Retention phoned and offered us a deal to stay, it was more or less what we were going to get if we changed provider so to save any hassle as we already had their phone line, we decided to stay. Took a further 4 calls before they eventually did as they promised. Phone line lasted 2 days - day 3 no phone line so called them, spent around 30 minutes n the phone to them until they decided somebody else needed to look at it. Would take around 5 days but would be repaired by midnight on Monday. Tuesday morning still no phone so called again, only to be told that there was a fault recorded on the line!! Well we hadn't worked that one out! We will send an engineer tomorrow as we have a cancellation, between 8am and 1pm. Well surprise surprise that time haas been and gone and we still do not have a working phone line :( If it were not for the fact that we still have the 2nd line that we hadn't cancelled we would not be able to contact anybody or keep a check on elderly relatives. It is costing us more to keep this line bt at least it is there which is one hell of a lot more than BT are.

Absolutely apauled with the BT service,"No zero rating available, that is what I'd give if I could. Absolutely apauled with the service I have received from BT recently. I have been trying to get my elderly (in their 80s) inlaws conected to the internet for the past 6 weeks. As they are now unable to travel to visit relatives they wanted this so they can video call relatives. Everything seemed to be going t plan until the engineers arrived to do the install the system. They could not carry out any work because they said the paper work they had did not match the address. It said the house was at plot 20 and not number 11. I rang BT to try and see what happened and got all sorts of excuses. I was asked if it was a new build, a carvan site etc, they have been living in the house for over 20 years. The order was then canceled and reordered again using the address house number 11 a week later the exact thing happened. BT said the address didn't exist, even though they had been sending them a phone bill for the past 20 odd years. Again the order was canceled and reordered and again the same happened. I got in touch with BT again and was told the way round it was to do a paper work exercise saying that my inlaws had moved from plot 20 to number 11. With three cancelations we have now received three BT hubs and phones. At long last they seemed to have got the address issue sorted and an engineer arrived last Friday to do the work. The BT man hole is less than 20 feet from the front door of the house. When he tried to install the fibre he found that the ducting had colapsed and he could not carry out the work. He said that the garden would have to be dug up to a depth of about 1meter and it could not be done by him he had to call another contractor. On sunday we had a medical emergency with my father inlaw and when they tried to phone an ambulance the phone was dead, if it haddn't been for my wife visiting who knows how things might have ended up, luckily she had her mobile with and used that. I contacted BT yet again and was told that their existing phone connection had been canceled because they had been conected to the new fibre line, which of course was not installed. I then told BT to forget the internet and that we urgently needed the phone reconnected. I was then told it wasn't as simple as that that a new contract had to be entered into and it could take up to a week. I agreed to this and told the person on the phone to go ahead and start the ball rolling only to be told they couldn't as it was a sunday and the contract people don't work at the weekends. She told me some one would ring me on Monday to sort things out. For the third time during this ordeal I was promised someone would ring me and they never bothered. BT is a shambles and should be ashamed of the way they treat customers especially as in this case they are elderly vulrnable people. I am now raising this matter with OFCOM as I am disgusted with the way BT have dealt with this.Update on my previous review, things have gone from bad to worse, 9 weeks on we have eventually got my inlaws phone back on, great you might think! but BT has charged them £70 to reconnect the phone, the phone that they disconnected with out being asked to. They say it's a new contract and therefore a new connection even though it was BTs cock up. Six times I was promised by BT operators that they would look into the issue and call me back, only one did and was of any help.  Appalling service and I am still persuing the complaint with OFCOM who have referred me to the CISAS.

Don't trust BT,I made the  mistake of trying to change a minor aspect of my broadband/calls package with BT. Simple you'd think but not to BT who made an absolute shambles of the entire process. They sent me emails saying I'd ordered a new mobile ( I specifically told them that I was happy with my present mobile) and a change to fibre ( not ordered by me) and which also confirmed an agreed engineering appointment I'd never made! I spoke to BT a number of times ( spent over two hours on this) and never spoke to the same person twice on their 0800 number.

Why did I come back to this company???,"Why did I come back to this company? 10+ years ago I had a nightmare experience with them and swore I'd never return. Last year I had had many problems with my broadband provider and BT had a special offer. I thought, perhaps they've improved? BIG Homer Simpson DOH!I signed up and the day came and of course BT didn't connect my internet as they promised. I use this for my business and internet is essential to receive card payments. So that day I went on an odyssey of help desks and hours upon hours of hold-time to get to speak to someone. Eventually, after an exceptionally painful day, a LOT of lost sales and a lot of heartache, I got internet. I was paying for the '4G Assure' service, which is supposed to mean that when the router/internet cuts out, the 4G dongle kicks in and you never lose internet. Guess what, IT DOESN'T WORK. The internet cuts out ALL THE TIME but the 4G NEVER kicks in.We had problems with the service from the start. Constantly dropping out. Range on router pathetic. Overall speeds pathetic. You know the deal, promised 17, guaranteed a min of 12, actually receive 2.. sometimes, if you're lucky.So more hours and hours on hold to get through to the hep desk and they run a bunch of tests and say, 'there's a problem on the line, we'll send an engineer; don't worry, you wont have to pay'. They also send me a text message, which they say is a 2-way service. Any problem in the future, just reply to this text and we'll come straight back to you, can skip waiting on hold. Awesome! I think....So engineer comes, fixes problem, internet works for a while. Then months later I get a bill for the engineer visit. I reply to the text message to challenge this. Of course, it doesn't work. NO ONE replies. More hours on hold at the help desk. And hours arguing of me saying, ""i was told I wouldn't have to pay"" and them claiming, yeah, you do. And a couple months later, the internet is dropping out again constantly. Cue more hours on hold. Another text message which I'm told I can use in the future (I explain the last one didn't work.. trust us, this one will work they say)...another engineer visit. This time he says (lovely guy he was) the line is fine but your router is shot. We install another one. It works for a while. (I'm expecting the bill in a few months of course)But eventually it stops working again. We get internet for about 2 hours a day, split up into 5 minute periods. Again I try the text message, again it doesn't work. Again on hold for ages. Also had massive problems with viewing my account on line. For months I would attempt login only to get a message saying, 'we're doing maintenance right now, please come back later'. More and more hours on hold to fix that one. It is quite simply and brutally awful service with even more epically brutally awful customer service to 'help' you when it goes wrong. CANNOT wait to leave.

Awful,"Awful.  TV and sport didn't work so had to cancel services within 14 day cooling off period.  BT then proceeded to try and bill for the entire length of the contract repeatedly.

When you speak to them they are pretty good and sorted things out, however BT would try and bill me a few days later and I'd have to go through it all again.

Finally I cancelled BT sport but they continued to charge me added in with my broadband package at a discounted price for 17 months without me noticing because I’m an idiot and didn’t check my online billing. Once I had a final bill in paper I seen that I was being charged for BT sport. The person I was dealing with the in call centre then blamed me for not checking my bill was right.

Overcharging My Elderly Aunt!,"On the 27th October, I was checking my aunt's phone bill and I was shocked to see she was charged for 26 123 (BT speaking clock) calls at 50p a call. My aunt has never phoned the speaking clock and she doesnt need to use her phone to find out the time. She also lives alone and no one else uses her phone.I contacted BT the same day and spoke to a lady from Liverpool. I told her my aunt hadn't made these phone calls but the lady repeatedly told me that these calls were made and my aunt would have to pay for them. I told her that I had checked my aunt's phone call history and their was no record on there of her contacting 123. I also assured her that my aunt is fully compos mentis.Eventually BT agreed to refund the money as a 'goodwill gesture' but they said in the future, 123 calls would have to be paid for. I told her that my aunt wasn't going to pay for calls she hadn't made, so the woman then refused to refund the money. I then asked to speak to her supervisor who agreed to refund the money but they still wernt prepared to accept the fact that my aunt hadn't made these calls.The direct debit was also increased from £22 to £34.50 as a result of these calls but the lady assured me she would have this reduced. I also asked her if anymore 123 calls had been made since the last bill and she said one had been made on the 23rd October. She said I could ring up BT in future to check on these 123 calls. On the 13th November, I noticed £34.50 was taken out of my aunt's account even though the lady told me the direct debit would be reduced. I phoned BT and spoke to Connor in the loyalty team. I asked him for my aunt's account balance which is now £20 in credit as a result of BT not reducing the direct debit. Connor said my aunt's monthly contract is £21.57 so I asked him to get the direct debit reduced which he said he was happy to do. £34.50 was obviously way too much to be charging my aunt. However when Connor spoke to the direct debit team, they refused to reduce the direct debit. Connor said my aunt either pays £34.50 a month or changes the contract to monthly where she pays the exact amount she owes. In normal circumstances this wouldn't bother me but this isn't normal circumstances. BT are refusing to believe that my aunt didn't make the 123 calls and are basically threatening my aunt to change her contract else they will continue overcharging her. It's infuriating to my aunt who believes that they are implying she's lying and are now trying to punish her, for contesting the previous charges, by trying to force her to change her contract. My aunt's had the same BT package for years and has never had any problems before. The speaking clock hasn't appeared on my aunt's bills in the past either. I told Connor that my aunt never made the calls to 123 and like the previous person I spoke too, he said the calls had been made. I told him their are no records on the phone of 123 calls been made but he still wouldn't listen. I asked him why 123 isn't appearing on my aunts phone call history if calls had been made to the speaking clock but he said he couldn't elaborate. They have made it clear they arent willing to investigate what is causing this fault. I asked Connor for an update on what calls had been made since the last bill but Connor said we would have to wait until January for this information. He said he can't tell us what calls have been made after the 22nd October yet the previous person I spoke too, told me their was a 123 call made on the 23rd October. The calls can obviously be checked but BT are now refusing to check these for my aunt. This is unfair because my aunt could get another expensive bill in January and BT won't give my aunt access to her own call logs in the meantime so she can keep an eye on the situation. All BT are prepared to do is overcharge her and take money off her for calls she hasn't made. Connor said BT can't block the 123 number either and he could only suggest changing my aunt's phone number.  Considering my aunt's had the same telephone number for years, she of course doesnt want to do this and doesn't see why she should have too. BT expect my aunt to go to the effort of changing her number yet they wont investigate these calls themselves. Connor also said that the 123 number has nothing to do with BT but it's a BT speaking clock! I'm confused how he can claim they have nothing to do with the BT speaking clock? What makes me laugh is that this was the loyalty team I was speaking too and they have proven they don't reward loyalty at all. My aunt has been with BT for years and this is how they treat her. I also came across a 'Which' article that talks about other people getting charged for 123 calls they hadn't made so this isn't an isolated incident.",Steve,2021,11,14,1,0.068,0.08,Positive

"Existing BT customer, shocking experience","Existing BT customer here, just looking to change the point the internet cable comes into the house, as part of a refurb. Organised a date with BT 2 weeks ago for an engineer to come and do this.We were given a window of 8am-1pm. No one here by 12.30, so we rang BT customer services and were promised an engineer was on their way and were just held-up. My wife stayed in for the rest of the afternoon, with our 3 young boys, holding up the refurb work, only for no engineer to appear. We ring BT this evening to understand how no one can appear and how the guidance at midday was that someone was on their way, only to be told that this was booked as a remote service and no one was ever going to come. Absolutely shocking service. Building works held-up and can’t even find an apology, let alone a suitable revised date for the work. Will now be leaving the service and would strongly recommend anyone assessing different suppliers to avoid BT.

"Useless Company, no service at all","I cant believe BT call themsleves a communication company, far from it.  Almost a year ago now back in November 2020 I called BT and asked if I could have Broadband fibre installed at my property.  I live off grid and have never had any services including a phone line.  I was told yes and that I would be setup and connected shortly.  I received a hub in the post and realised it needed to be plugged into a phone socket in the wall which I did not have.  I had told Bt this but no one listened as on the 21st December after telling me I now had my service I asked them well how can I have it if I dont have a phone line.  Oh dear they said, and realised they had cut my neighbours service provider off.  They apologised and told me that it was their mistake (obviously) and said they would sort me out and would do it for free.  In February 2021 I had a visit from Open reach and they advised me that it would be more beneficial to dig a trench through the steep woods that I have and run copper cable to the bottom of my woods where they would errect a pole and get me connected.  They supplied the cable and I paid a digger driver £600 to dig the trench and lay their cables for them.  When I told them I had done this they said to contact BT and ask for it to be connected I told them that the pole was not there yet but they said to still contact BT. A few days later an engineer came out to connect me and said ""I cant connect you as there is no pole"" leave it with me he said.  Guess what nothing happened a month later I chased up to find that my call had been closed and that no pole was being erected therefore.  Meanwhile I am being charged a monthly fee, which is growing all the time and I have not paid this as I have no service I have received nothing to pay for.  I have been contacting them non stop mow monthly and everytime I call I explain the problem and get put on hold and it goes round in circles.  Finally in October I spoke to someone who again apologise and said they understood my frustration, NO they didn't.  He then said lets cancel your account and start all over again so we can get you set-up.  He also said an engineer would be out the following week.  When the engineer didn't show, I called BT again to be told that my account had been closed so I now have to wait for two weeks its called a two week cooling off period.  I was not cooling off at this BT telephone staff I was told that even though they could see I dont really owe them the money I am now under a poor credit rating on their system so they wont allow me to have an appointment without paying a fee of £70.  Are you kidding me is this for real.  The final straw last week was when I spoke to a gentleman called Josh who again said he understood my frustration, he put me on hold and surprise surprise the phone goes dead having been on the call for 45 mins.  I get a text from Josh apologising saying that he has a problem with his phone REALLY your BT and you have a problem with your phone.  He gave me his email address and asked me to contact him as he is working on getting me sorted out.  i emailed back and guess what,, that was over a week ago now, i have heard nothing.  This company is appalling it treats people like utter rubbish.  I am now speaking with another company called Airwaves who actually do what they say they are going to do.  Theye are going to give me more speed with a satellite dish, free Netflix etc and they are going to actually do the job for just £30 a month and i will have access to 100mbs download so great for gaming.  I just hope that BT take me to court for the outstanding money they stupidly think I owe.

Don't get BT TV,"I returned a BT TV because I decided that it wasn't worth paying for every month. The TV box has a number of design flaws. If the unit is powered off properly, it can take up to two minutes to boot up. In smart mode which is constantly sucking up electricity when not doing anything, has a constant whirring sound. When I turn something offf, I want it to be off.The interface is messy, can't really be customised all that well. It's pretty much just a freeview box with a few extra streaming apps. It doesn't have Disney+ so that's yet another deal breaker for me too. It doesn't have ITV Hub. They wanted £20 for an activation fee (What is that for?!) They charged me £9.99 for postage and, to top it all off, they want to charge me £12 a month for the enteratinment TV package, which is £9.99 from Now by the way. So it's a series of being screwed again and again. After initially paying for fibre broadband at £28.99 and recieving a bill for £61.30 a month later for unused TV services it was a bit of a shock. I had returned the BT TV box two weeks ago via my local post office before recieving an email telling me that I may have to pay a £115 cost for the TV box if it is not returned to them. £115 for a piece of garbage. Thanks BT. It's alright though, I have my receipt from the post office, so you just try chargine me that amoount of money. It's not worth half of that.So needless to say that in combination with my energy bill this month and BT could have cost me £118.69 for one month. I'm a single guy, I make enough to pay the bills, but that figure is quite frankly ridiculous. I'd much rather just save the money and hook up my mac to the TV or something. I phone BT customer services and told them my situation, to either delay the bill so that I can afford to pay it, or refund me for the unused TV sercies. The lady on the other end was very understanding of my situation and has given me a refund. £29.99 and £2.20 for what I presume would be a weeks worth of Now entertainment package. They refunded it all. I have two emails to back that up.Now the question is what is is this mysterious activation charge, because my understanding is that the BT TV box or Youview Pro as it's really called is just a smart freeview box with a few bundled apps on it like Netflix and Britbox. So why are you charginc customers activation fees. What exactly is being activated? You're not Sky. There's no viewing card. It's a bad freeview smart box with a few included apps in it.Now ending on a more positive not the fibre broadband is fantastic. So extra star for BT. Speeds are consistent. No major problems with that, except for wires hanging on my wall but hey, it does work... kinda.",Jon,2021,11,11,2,0.062,0.088,Positive
Stay Away From Halo3 its a pure rip off,"I am going through a divorce the bills which were in my husbands name are being transferred to my name. The way that BT does this is to treat me as a new customer. The man I spoke to said I would get a new router, and then asked lot of questions about my usage. I hardly use my landline but I did want to keep it. I stressed that my TV is a very old analogue TV and I didn't want HBO ore Sky. At the end of the call he raced through what I would be getting and I heard him mention HBO & Sky which I again said I don't want. He told me the 29.99 install charge would be refunded and that an engineer would come round to set everything up for me. I told him my security cameras work off the wifi He assured me that the engineer would not leave until everything was working properly.The first thing the engineer did was tell me he didn't know anything about my security cameras and it wasn't his job to make sure they were connected. He looked at my TV and after some time said he could not connect the new Freeview box because of the difference in the sockets on it or something like that. I again said that I had told the man on the phone how old my TV was. He had been here some time and said he would leave the phones and I could still use my landline. When I picked up my phone it was dead. The engineer arrived the day before I was due to go on holiday. On my return I have made several calls to BT each have lasted a long time. Every time I call I have to go through the whole thing again. I thought the matter was resolved as the loyalty team told me they would cancel my whole order and then I could place a new order just for broadband. But I have made yet another call today and found that my complaint has been closed and I will have to stay on the package that was miss sold to me for 2 years!!! I am so shocked that BT has absolutely no integrity whatsoever. I have been miss sold a package that I do not want or need. I am very angry indeed to find I am paying £76 for broadband. I thought that staying with BT would be easier but in fact it has been a total nightmare from start to finish. How much commission are they paying their staff to rip me off?

Change to fibre chaos,"I am an existing customer of BT and wanted to change the fibre package we are on. Arranged it all through BT and it seemed very simple. I work from home, delivering training which people may have been booked on for months. Like most home workers, I can not afford for my internet to go down for an extended time. Day 1. The Open reach engineer arrived unplanned 10 days early. I checked with him at the door that by installing the new box I would not lose connection. He assured me I would not so I let me carry out the work even though we had not yet received the new Hub from BT. Day 2. No Internet. Called BT who said Open reach shouldn't have done the work without having the hub. I was told I would have no internet until I received the new hub but they would send it new day delivery and there was no point in sending an emergency hotspot as they would sort it all out tomorrow.  Day 3. New hub arrives. They sent the wrong one. Called BT, they will send another. Day 4, 5, 6, 7 we wait for the new hub, and wait, and wait. Day 8. Hub arrives (hurrah). It doesn't work. Called BT. Apparently the order is still open at the warehouse and so they can not connect me. But they will call me back at lunch they next day to get it resolved. Day 9. No call back. I call BT them to discover that the only team who can resolve this issue have a 48hour turn around time. I receive another hub in the post. I will say that all, barring one person I have spoke to has had a good tone and manner. BT have obviously spent a lot of money on customer services training! However, they are completely let down by the terrible systems that seem to be in place within the company.  So I am still without internet, unable to work effectively. I have lost hours on the phone to BT and further working hours by being reliant on slow mobile phone hotspot data connection.

I made a terrible mistake,"I made a terrible mistake. Was with TalkTalk and they put the price up as soon as my contract period ended so I thought I'd switch.Went with BT and I've regretted it every single day since. They're cheap enough but that's because their service is genuinely not fit for purpose. My connection drops out around 50 times a day at a minimum, for 2-3 mins each time, sometimes longer. Often these cut outs happen back to back for 2-3 hours so the Internet is completely unusable. Not so much a problem when I'm using my phone as it switches to mobile data but I work from home and need to be consistently connected through my laptop through the day. Also its making my kids lives a misery.

I've been advised to take screen shots every time the Internet drops, showing date and time, I've been doing this since yesterday and so far I have 64 screenshots showing that my phone has switched to mobile data because of poor or no connection with BTI would contact them about it but they make it so difficult to talk to a human, and when you do finally get a human they don't understand English  and just keep repeating themselves and don't actually help (I've had to contact them about different issues 3 times since signing up, never had to contact TalkTalk once) so I'm taking legal action instead of wasting my timePlease avoid them!",Jen,2021,11,8,1,0.127,0.022,Negative

Terrible,"My mum has had BT for years and they've always been reasonable, no complaints.The last few months have been so bad. There was a fault on our line which was apparently fixed (it wasn't) and we were fobbed off for weeks and tests on the line before they recognised there was an issue and that it wasn't our fault! Finally, it was fixed. Only for Digital Voice to be installed a few weeks later, without her asking and no knowledge of what that meant! Someone just turned up and installed it! Didn't mention anything extra..We had no idea that our current one wouldn't work and you'd have to buy a new handset!The information on the website seems knowingly vague!And to add insult to injury, it's gone from £59 to £69 in the space of a few days!(edit: just a certain handset that I thought we needed to get has gone up. Apparently, there is more than one you can get but it's so confusing, as none of the photos and videos matches the current handsets.So, I've just had to guess based on the names still listed to work in the website manual.Really disappointed how unclear Digital Voice is.",WW,2021,11,7,1,0.127,0.007,Negative

CEO - deliver what you promised,"Update log17/11 - No responsePhilip Jansen, chief executive, BT Group, said: “Small businesses are the beating heart of our economy, high streets and communities. They employ the majority of private sector workers in the UK, so their success is key to securing the country’s economic recovery from the pandemic. Small businesses deserve the support of each and every one of us to help them thrive into the future.”I own a small business (Pub/restaurant) near Evesham and only get 10-14MB. 4G if flaky we are lucky if we get 3 or more bars and there are no 5G plans from any of the telco providers.  This is the UK just 2.5 hours drive from London - not Mars (which, incidentally, has better comms link with the Mars rover right now)We can't even offer customers a reliable wifi service, our EPOS and phones are cloud based and our card readers require strong wifi coverage.  We are forced to use this technology yet the very providers of the infrastructure have no interest in supporting us.The issue, I'm told, is that the nearest fiber cabinet (200 mtrs away) is too far from the building so they have to use a copper line.  The only way to fix this is if I pay for the fiber to be laid by rallying other business owners to share the cost.Customer service is not fit for purpose and takes 20-30 minutes to get through.  They are still hiding behind the covid challenges and using the ""your call is important to us"" and ""we are experiencing high call volume"" excuses.  Of course they are busy because there are too many complaints and not enough agents to answer them (to reduce costs and improve share price). Once you've managed to navigate the triage of which keys to press you then go into another queue only to be asked the very same questions that you've already punched into the phone. The sales line tends to get answered immediately.Note how all the BT agent responses on this thread are 'cut & paste' comments (probably auto-responders) urging you to contact them using social media.  Surely they have a better escalation process than this - it's disgraceful and really is a sad indictment when a customer cannot communicate effectively with a leading communication company. Having worked in the industry myself for 35 years I can assure you that your complaint is not being reported through the support desk and is most likely closed as 'resolved' for reporting purposes if you don't follow up.  It makes the numbers look good for senior management.Another customer has pointed out just how efficient their billing, sales and installation services can be.  It's a disappointment that the same level of focus and attention is not invested in customer care. To be fair, all the telcos are the same.  Focused on selling new services, attract new customers, provide the least-cost-support possible and improve the share price.  It's a 'churn' business where customers leave and come back 2 years later because the new telco is no better.  Check them all on this site and you will see that 1.5 to 2 is an average score.  With ratings like that they would be out of business in my trade.BT CEO (Philip Jansen), I'm sure you enjoy going to the pub as much as the next person but companies like yours are putting us under enormous financial pressure with high charges and poor service.  Imagine you visited a pub and was asked you to wait 30 minutes to be served, send you emails that you can't reply to, prompt you to use social media to contact us, promise to resolve any complaints within the next 2 weeks or simply offer you something that we can't deliver.  Then send you a bill.Whilst you make £1.5 billion profit a year we are a small business and we need your help to survive.

Unfortunately since the move, the broadband speeds have been well under half the ‘guaranteed minimum’ in my package. Two engineers (one contractor and one Openreach) have failed to fix the issue, while BT phone and online customer service has been abysmal. Excessive waiting times on the phone, and fabricated closure of complaints online advising that ‘the customer has advised the fault has been fixed’. Promises to contact me and then failing to do so. Escalating the issues has been met by a wall of silence. Truly pathetic and this is only one month into their ‘service’.

Unusable good speeds,"I though bt was meant to be the best in the UK. How wrong could I have been?!? I’ll start with the only good thing which is the speeds- 130mb download and 30mb upload at best. So downloading things is normally pretty quick. But if you want to play online games on a console, pc or mobile you might as well go back to a dial up connection as the latency / ping is absolutely shocking! Bounces between 4-450+ sometimes. This also makes phone calls drop if you are connected to wifi call on a mobile. Every now and then the connection will just disconnect and reconnect. I’ve tried so many things, contacted bt multiple times. Their representatives on the phone are always polite and seem to be knowledgeable, they have sent me multiple extra devices and told me to buy others that they cant supply. Even spent hundreds on getting multiple  ethernet cables run to rooms and (close to the main router) outbuildings. The tech they sent out didn’t have a clue either and informed me that everything was fine and that they are not trained in latency so he couldn’t help with that. After reading other peoples frustrations I honestly can’t believe how bad the service BT provide is.Edit: how ironic is it that the link from a ‘bt representative’ was incorrect and the page cannot be displayed.

Wrongful blacklisting with credit agencies,"I moved house in June and it took weeks to transfer the broadband.

Customer Service is appalling. They have told me I need to take the matter up with Experian and Equifax which is proving time-consuming and so far fruitless.

"If I could give zero stars, I would! I cried down the phone to them after begging them to refund me money they wrongly took via direct debit, leaving me without means to feed my family","When I moved to my new house, I had 2 options. BT or Sky. BT claimed to be  able to get my broadband up and running quicker, so I chose them.They made a mess of my order due to internal mess ups, meaning my ‘go live’ date was two weeks behind schedule, leaving me working from home with no internet for almost a month after moving in. I was then wrongly charged a connection fee in my first bill, after being told that it had been waived when I signed up. Two months later, I receive a text from my bank, stating that I have 82p remaining in my account. When I check why this is, I notice that BT have taken £140 out of my account instead of £27! I check my bill and find that I’ve been charged for the second set of equipment that I was sent (through their error when I was first connected), even though I’d returned this. I’d even had texts to confirm receipt of the equipment! I tried to call customer service immediately, but was stuck in a queue for over 30 minutes. I decided to use the chat service instead and explained my situation. The person on the chat said I could have credit on my account. I explained that I needed a refund as I am a single mum on a very low income. The person assured me that I’d have a refund within 48 hours. The refund never came.Three days later, I’d completely run out of food in the house and had no money to buy any more, thanks to BT rinsing me dry. I used the chat facility again (phone lines went open) to ask where my refund was. The person on the other end didn’t tell me why I hadn’t received it yet. All I could get out of them was ‘I’ve processed a refund for you and it’ll be with you in 5 working days’. Of course, I was in tears and begged the person to help me sooner because my child was going without food. The person wouldn’t help at all and wouldn’t tell me why the money hadn’t come in already/why I was told a refund had been processed when it clearly hadn’t. The following day, I called BT to ask what was going on and whether I was going to get a refund. I was told that the refund had been processed when I first contacted them, and it should be with me within 5 working days of that day (one more day). They couldn’t tell me why I’d originally been given a time frame of 48 hours and didn’t offer me anything by way of a quicker solution to get the money back in my account when I desperately needed it. Again, I explained that I couldn’t feed my son or afford to get to work. They didn’t care one bit. I asked to open a complaint and was told that a manager would call me. They never did.Two further days later, I am still waiting for my money. I called BT YET AGAIN and was told that the refund hadn’t even  been processed yet, and it’ll be 5 working days from today! So basically everybody I’d spoken to until this point was basically lying to me! He couldn’t explain why I’d been given wrong information so many times or why the manager had never called me. He also tried to blame me for not responding to texts I’d received from them threatening to bill me for the equipment previously. When I explained that I thought these were sent in error, as they’d also text me to thank me for returning the equipment, I was simply told ‘you should’ve called to check’. Umm no, BT should keep better track of what they receive and what they don’t. I asked for compensation, a call back from a manager, my money back ASAP and to cancel my account with them as soon as I found another provider, with no exit fee, due to the awful service and terrible inconvenience I’d suffered. I was told no to every single one of these. Again, I cried to the person on the phone about having no money for food. Again they couldn’t care less and hung up on me.Not sure if I’ll ever see my money again, but I recommend avoiding BT like the plague.

BT don’t support elderly customers,"My elderly parents (84+ years) have recently moved.  2 weeks prior to the move Dad arranged for BT to install/provide phone, broadband & tv.  The guy confirmed an engineer would be at the new address between 10am-midday on 26/10/21 to install 3 phone points and connect the broadband & tv.  My parents waited in but no engineer turned up.  Dad called and was told there was no trace of the order. Dad was not impressed but when he wanted to escalate the problem he was told that senior management was working from home and couldn’t be readily contacted!  The best the BT representative could do was to re-book the job but the earliest an engineer could visit would be 12/11/21!!!This is totally unacceptable as our parents are dependent on a phone line; contacting family, doctors etc.I couldn’t recommend BT based on this experience as they don’t care about supporting elderly customers.- -update - -Mandy from BT contacted me today to apologise and asked that I contact BT via Twitter or Facebook, requesting that I mention my parents are dependent on a phone line, so that BT can address the issue.One problem I do not have a Twitter account nor do I use Facebook.I live 200+ miles from my parents however, thankfully, my sister lives nearer.  My sister & her husband drove to my parents new home today so that they could use her mobile phone.  My sister managed to contact their new doctor who was extremely supportive.  However when she contacted BT they refused to talk to her as she is not registered on my parents (inactive) account.  Arggh!Dad eventually managed to convince BT that my sister was able to speak on their behalf. The new BT representative was helpful and admitted the initial BT guy had messed up and not processed their order correctly however there was no apology and the earliest my parents will receive a landline will be early November and BT tv will be installed a few days later.  My poor parents are fed up, annoyed and, at the moment, feel ‘cut off’.  I’m so frustrated for my parents.  My father is registered disabled and is reliant on a phone line and the internet.  They both enjoy watching tv but cannot watch anything until next month.

You spend ages researching other companies and arrange to move contracts, then BT contact you to say they WILL reduce their price after all. I have done this SO many times, that this time they hiked up the prices, I asked for email only.  Several times I have received emails to say they will only speak on the telephone, despite my asking for email contact. They email that unless I speak to them, they will not answer my complaint and are happy that I take my business elsewhere.

"What We Say Goes, So Don't Tell Us Your .....","My wife aged 77, a former optician has been with BT since 1981. She is disabled, in poor health, and receives Pension Credit, this qualifies her for the Basic Broadband package costing £18.00 per month, they claim the price should be £24.99 pm. We ordered the Basic Package and now have it installed a saving of £7.00 per month. After the installation occurred  B.T informed us they do not believe she is on Pension Credit so will not give her/us the agreed discounted price. So far three conversations have been held with BT about this but there is no way we can convince them they are in the wrong, to do so we obtained a letter from the Pension Service proving her entitlement claims but BT do not have a Department that can handle disputes or prove claims;  if they say you are not on Pension Credit then you're not on Pension Credit. And if you do not pay their incorrect bills, they will cut you off. If a BT monitor sees this post will they tell us who to send the Pension's Service letter to, because your staff does not appear to know?PS:  If Paddy.

This company's service is utterly appalling,"This hopeless company is bureaucratic and unhelpful to a shocking degree. Separating the phone service from the infrastructure should never have been permitted. The phone cables have pulled a brick most of the way out of my wall. This was extremely dangerous as it could have killed somebody. When I called BT to deal with it ay 0930, they tried to palm me off, giving me the number for Open Reach and telling me to deal with it myself. This alone I found unacceptable as I have no relations hip with Open Reach. However, Open Reach weren't accepting calls anyway and only prepared to take contact though its website. But I am in a remote part of Scotland at present while my house is in Wiltshire. I was unable to go online and, in an urgent matter, that should not be necessary. After speaking to four different BT personnel of little intelligence, I finally bullied someone into connecting me with Open Reach, who I hope have now fixed the problem, although nobody has had the courtesy to confirm that to me. The brick could easily have fallen out and killed someone. The BT people refuse to call me back as one might imagine common courtesy would suggest - especially at a phone company. Instead I was made to wait entirely unnecessarily on hold for a cumulative 50 minutes while BT's hopeless staff achieved nothing. This company and its service are a disgrace.",Gregory,2021,10,22,1,0.167,0.097,Negative

He told me that I needed to have the digital line ( which I had asked for on my first order as I had to pay for the phone they sent out) he told me that it may take up to 5 days to change over but my land line would work until then.

The Home hub was checked for speed and everything was tickety boo when they left, except that it wasn't. Nothing changed, the problem remained, I tried to reopen the case, but it said that it had been resolved (oh no, no, no!), So there was another appointment made for an engineer to come out to me for a few days later. They never turned up! It transpired that someone in their wisdom decided that my problem had been resolved and my appointment was cancelled without informing me and I waited in like a lemon all day for them to arrive. The following day, I chased them up about it, got a very apologetic lady on the phone who said that an appointment had never been made until I told her the job number, etc, then she found it. It strangely had disappeared from my emails (weird), but then she made another appointment. This time someone did actually arrive. A very helpful chap who did his utmost to improve the quality of my broadband speed and said that it was now fixed. Yeah, but no... Two days later, I'm back to square one, crackling line, diabolical internet connection, a half hour wait to get anywhere near a place in the queue for assistance and my patience is wearing extremely thin.

Save yourself and get another broadband / phone provider,"BT is probably the most inefficient company (not broadband/phone company, but company in general) that I have ever dealt with. Their customer service is laughable. One day they'll tell you one thing, another day you'll be told the exact opposite with the same level of certainty. Want to put a request for something? Don't do it over the phone. Everyone behind that phone is either completely incompetent or they don't really care about you or their job. Some of the issues that I've recently experienced in the last 2 months:1. Home move - don't even attempt to do this, if you can, get out of your contract. I placed a home move over the phone and it didn't show up for a number of days under Orders in my account - so I called back and they told me that the person I had talked to ""forgot to put it in the system"", seriously? One person in customer service told me to close my account and that I would have to get a new router and return my current one, and the second time I called they told me that I had been ill-advised, and that I could move home with my current router. 2. They give you a mini-hub while you moving between houses! Sounds nice right?  Until they disconnect it for no apparent reason so you are left as A. a paying customer B. without internet. 3. How long with the activation take in your new flat? The first person I called said 14 days with certainty, the second told me that there is really no way of knowing that. I have hundreds of these anecdotes with BT, these are just from the last couple of months when dealing with a move. As soon as I am out of contract - I'm switching to WHATEVER else is available.

Took away my landline and now say they cannot communicate with me,"I transferred to BT from Plusnet when Plusnet discontinued Plusnet TV. That was at the end of August and since then it has been an absolute nightmare. I was totally mis-sold a package, which when I checked contained none of the things that I had requested. One of the worst was that BT discontinued my land line with neither my knowledge nor my permission. Since then it has been one endless stream of calls and emails as BT has consistently tried to block and stonewall me. Unfortunately, in the midst of this my mobile phone has developed an intermittent fault so that sometimes my voice is not heard. As a result BT has unilaterally closed my complaint.This has left me in a vulnerable position. I am 74 years old and live alone. Although, I am in good health (or think I am) at 74 things can go wrong, so having a working land line is essential to me in case of emergency, especially if my mobile decides to play up at that time. Also, the sheer effrontery of terminating my landline with, I repeat, neither my knowledge nor my permission galls.

Totally wasted hours on the phone (BT customer service is staffed by the rudest, most confrontational halfwits) and I had to take out ANOTHER contract.Fast forward a MONTH, and after EIGHT missed appointments by BT to re connect me, finally Internet is restored.

"Pensioner with heart condition, living alone with no mobile signal is not vulnerable say BT","I have fibre broadband and digital phone to the property.

(There is no mobile signal in my area).I asked BT for one of their battery backup units and waited for five weeks to get a reply, calling virtually every day. Told someone would order one or would call back No one ever did. Finally I was told that unless I met the criteria for a vulnerable person, I would not be eligible.

Never giving BT my business again,"Never giving BT my business again. Had them for a few years, through 3 different homes and I never got broadband on the day I was supposed to for any of them. The prices are too high compared to competitors, the wifi is rarely up to the speed it's supposed to be and the customer service is shocking.       Recently moved into a new flat, I work from home so I needed the WiFi to be in on the day I moved, it was essential. I booked the appointment weeks in advance and I checked the order a week before to see the address was wrong; It had my apartment number but not the building number. I called up to correct it, they said it couldn't be changed without placing a new order so I'd lose my appointment and would have to wait two weeks for another (What?! Its changing an address, just update it), but I was assured the connection team did have the building number and it would be fine. Nope! Guy turned up, said the address was wrong and I couldn't get connected. Called up BT, was on hold for an hour, had to repeat my case to 3 different people as I was bounced around on the phone, eventually to find out they'd have to cancel the appointment and because their system sucks they couldn't place another till the following day, after which it would be another two weeks before installation. This wasn't acceptable so I escalated and was told I'd get a call from a manager at 10am the next day. 10:40 and still no call, rang BT again and after being on hold for 30 minutes I learned this had never been arranged. I decided to move to another provider since I was sick of them but they assured me no provider could get my wifi any sooner. Rubbish, went with Hyperoptic who could get my wifi installed 4 days later, over 10x the speed thanks to a great deal they had for £12 less. But thanks to BT i was trying and failing to do my job from an internet cafe all week thanks to their screw up.

My BT Experience,"I have been with BT for internet and landline for many years - since just after dial-up ended but you needed a filter on your phone-line - something like 15-18 years.Initially they were hopeless and wouldn't acknowledge that my slow internet speed was their fault.Eventually I got an engineer who cared enough to sort the problem but it took several years (around 10-12).Currently I am on Fibre Halo 2 (FTTC) and pay my landline line rental using BT's line saver - that said I find that I am paying £51 a month for internet connectivity and a land line that only gets phoned by scammers and not used by us to call anybody.So, I'm looking for a FTTP suppplier that's both reliable and cheaper than BT.I checked one of the switching sites and found Vodafone FTTP for either £21.50 for 73Mbps or £24 for 100Mbps - both with a free landline.So I called BT to see what deal they can do for me and I spoke to this nice guy in their Retentions Team. Best he could advise was Full Fibre 100 Halo 3 which he said was FTTP and, not including a phone line, would be £32.98 without a landline.Hmm!! Let me think. So BT is more expensive? Yes says Retention Man, but we are the best - check out Trustpilot reviews. Well I have and BT are far from the best according to the reviews, scoring 1.5. This is only marginally better to Vodafone's 1.3.I'm not sold on Vodafone and will keep looking but its looking very much like its bye-bye BT.Hardly a ringing endorsement.",John G,2021,10,13,3,0.032,0.173,Positive

If you can just increase the price like that, what's even the point of the contract. I raised a complaint and have yet to receive anything back. and it has been over 3 months. Very deceptive practice. Now, Less than halfway through the contract the internet is playing up and it is so frustrating, my cellular is faster and consistent than this.

Awful,"What an absolute shower anything to do with calling BT is. If you have an issue all you can do is go through an automated system which as with all these systems rarely is able to sort out your specific problem.The only way i manged to speak to a human was by selecting the upgrade package etc option then got flogged an upgrade which was supposed to sort my issue.After receiving no confirmation on this I called, this time, selecting the complaints option. Turns out no new router was sent as promised/agreed.I promptly cancelled this new contract and asked to have an issue i have with seemingly two active accounts and have now been on the phone 35 minutes and counting, mostly and currently on hold!So glad my contract ends in a week.I would advise not using this company.Oh look, i just got cut off whilst on hold!",Dan Edwards,2021,10,7,1,0.077,0.037,Negative

Signed up in June and still not fully up and running,"Signed up in June, and was due for an install for BT Fibre and Digital voice on 1st July.  The Kelly's engineer who came said that the job would take too long, and he didn't get paid to do what we wanted, so he left without doing anything.  We then had a 3 week delay to get the installation done with a BT engineer, who to be fair was great.So.. our new fibre line was up and running on 23rd July.  It's now 7th October and we still do not have the digital voice - the initial transfer failed, and then BT seemed to close the call.  Roll on to end of August, and they put in a new request to transfer phone from old company to BT on copper, then once BT had the line, to transfer from copper to Fibre.  This was meant to complete yesterday.  Email / text to say all working.  It isn't.  Back on the phone to BT, who have had to refer to the tech team, which is 5 days.  There seems to be a technical configuration issue somewhere in the system.  So we currently have no phone line at all, and no way to expedite the fixing.  So... it's been nearly 3.5 months since we should have been up and running and nearly 3 months since the fibre installation, and we're still not sorted.  Actually as of today we are actually worse off, as our phone worked until yesterday.  Ready to throw the whole lot out the window at this stage...",Kirsten Hackman,2021,10,7,1,0.05,0.018,Negative

Read it if you are leaving BT,"I am writing this review so that other is aware of this BT error and make sure they don’t fall on this BT trap. I manage my 81 years aged father utility accounts. He was with BT for 20 years and in April 2021 when there was renewal BT increased his bill. He is on weekend call and basic broad band package. Called BT but they would not offer any better deal so changes to John Lewis for Phone and broad band. When the transfer initiated BT called and reduced the price to keep with BT. But John Lewis deal was still better , so he said no. I received an email from BT that telephone transfer request received and as we are moving phone service broadband will cost 29.99 every month. I called BT again and told them we are moving both and was assured everything was cancelled. In September my father saw direct debit from BT of 99.97 and called me. I called BT and told everything. I was phone for 90 minutes. I told them my last call to BT that I informed after getting the email that only telephone transfer not broad band transfer and I was assured that everything was cancelled. But to my surprise nothing was documented about that call. Only a record of my call that day. So I asked to see the phone record as they always say conversation is recorded. Customer service told me that they. Can’t find it . I was told to speak to locality team. I told him that we are not with BT and service is provided by John Lewis so why BT is taking money from my dad. Another half an hour wait on phone and then customer service told me that they think it was BT’s fault and will return 198 pounds debited from my father. If you are leaving BT don’t rely on them, call them tht everything cancelled and keep a name of that person. If possible record the conversation.",shamim ahmed,2021,10,6,2,0.07,0.036,Negative

I had BT TV but decided to cancel as the variety is boring and as soon as I said I wished to cancel the man I spoke to was rude and dismissive. I've been with BT for over 2 years and recently decided to cancel and find something cheaper and a better service, I was referred to the loyalty team and was spoken to quite rudely by the woman. I know their job is to keep customers but she came across as very disrespectful and forceful.

"Very poor technical help, unreliable service","After a new installation from BT I was pretty happy to have chosen the higher fibre connection.  It turns out though that because I am quite far away from the junction box; my speed is slower than expected.  Which is fine.  It is quick enough.The problem is that the connection regularly dips to a very slow speed (1.4mbps is not uncommon), and sometimes just drops out all together.When I download a large file, it knocks out the connection on all of my other devices.  I read somewhere that points at this being an ISP setting, but the helpline staff just automatically send out someone from openreach without actually looking at the problem.  The guy at openreach said it was an ISP thing and not his problem.I need a solid connection in the house, so I upgraded to the EE bonded service.  Although it seems like the whole BT line needs to have failed before that kicks in (rather than it kicking in when it is faster than the broadband).   So it is pretty useless.I have had to have another line installed in my house now so that I can deal with the regular dips in service.As soon as my contract ends.

Worst service possible,"Trying to recover today after 3 continuous hours on the phone to BT yesterday. It started last Thursday when we phoned to complain about our internet connection. they promised an engineer for the following morning and one duly turned up at 8am only they were at our previous address ( we moved on the 10 September) . He came to our address but he was a fibre to house specialist and we are fibre to cabinet so he promised someone would call us back which they did and eventually we were put thorough to J who told us that despite us informing BT of our move and after being assured that everything was okay they had not altered the address on their system. He promised he would call back on Saturday as he was working and sent a text to confirm he would call between 10:30 - 12:30.Yesterday I waited in for two hours but no call so at 12:35 I called and first of all spoke to H who could not help so he put me through to M at the fibre to cabinet team who told me that they had not cancelled the services at our old address and our new address needed to be put on the system , she transferred me to I at the Values department where I asked to speak to a supervisor but he would not put me thorough. He said I needed a new account and without it they could not do anything so we went through the detail and agreed  the amount etc . He could not give me a date for it to be switched to our new address so he put me through to sales support where after another 45 minutes holding on I spoke to H from the Early Life Team. I asked her if the order had been placed and she put me back into the system and after 2hours 45 minutes I was put thorough to S in Sales support who put me thorough to R at the Full fibre Team . He confirmed the order was in place but put me thorough to K at the Loyalty Team who then repeated everything I had gone through with I to set up a new account and confirmed a date of 13 October. Under the circumstances I requested that the date be expedited and she said she would put me through to the Connections Team and gave me a number  01793591207 , At 03:58 I was cut off and when I tried to dial the number she gave the call failed. To compound the problem BT sent me an email to activate the new account but K in the loyalty team had not entered my mother's maiden name correctly so I am unable to activate the account.

I am a long standing customer of BT and… update,"I am a long standing customer of BT and have always valued their product.  I have Broadband, landline and mobiles.  On a recent call I was persuaded to upgrade to Halo 3+.  It was only a few more pounds.  I got my packages very quickly and set things up.  I had not realised that this upgrade meant that my 3 analogue phones were to be made redundant when I signed up.  It was not made clear but I thought why not the phones had become troublesome.  I spent ages putting in the numbers from the old to the new handset deleting them as I went to save confusion.  Great I thought.The following day there was something wrong.  The phone said it could not make or receive calls.  The detail that came with the kit is lacking so I rang BT.  After trying a few things a remote reboot was done and all was seemingly well. Sadly not.  It transpired that all the details I had carefully entered were lost.  I was not happy and rang BT.  I explained the problem and asked that they restored the details.  Seemingly they can’t.  I was not happy.  All they could say was that this sort of thing rarely happens.  I asked for my old phone line back but they said they could not do this.  I asked why was I not told about this risk when I agreed the upgrade.  There was no answer they could give.I wrote to BT and got a call.  I explained my frustration and asked why BT are selling such a poor handset; one without any means of backing it up.  I pointed out that the handset details say you can have up to 5 all inter connected but that they are not available to buy.  All I learned from this chat was that a power cut will also knock out the stored numbers.So after all of this I could not recommend an upgrade to BT digital unless you want to do away with your landline.  As for the Broadband offer I am still working out what the benefits are from the upgrade.David. Thanks for your interest.   I eventually found out how to contact Bt via Facebook. I did suggested and made reference to this review.  It was pointless as I was asked what the problem was.  The conclusion of our exchange was that hopefully the tech visit would sort things out and if not to contact them again.All very good but that does it change the fact that I have been oversold a product that has left me with a worse system than I had before, I am in a contract that has no get out clause and all the investment in phones and bt whole home wifi has been lost.  Interestingly we now have fibre in the street but I am told no connection plans for some time yet.By way of an update.  There is a guy called Adam working for BT (I think based in Liverpool) he has been great in trying to sort a few things.  The good news is that with this phone a power cut does not result in the loss of contacts as I was told it would be a BT man in Ireland.  I also worked out how to make Alexa work; the phone instructions are little help but having worked it out it’s not worth the bother really.  In all of this I also realised that the cold calling protection offer is not as good as before.  So my opinion has not changed on the overall experience with this new phone set up and I will probably now move away from a house phone.  As I say Adam was great but my old system was better.",Steve Lo,2021,10,2,1,0.11,0.113,Positive

Although he himself couldn’t fix the issue immediately, he was intelligent, friendly and professional and I actually felt confident it would get sorted after I put the phone down. I then received update texts from an BT and the problem was fixed. S*** happens right?

"Installation delays, time wasted at customer services",I’ve had a scheduled and confirmed appointment for the engineer to arrive and install my wifi on the 27th September between 8am-1pm. Like a moron i got up early and eagerly awaited for their visit. After 1pm came i called BT up and was informed that my appointment is now on the 30th and that the next one available if i can’t make that one will be on the 11th october.I was not contacted in any manner to be updated about my appointment. Not by phone not by email or otherwise.When i called the agent on phone she just kept spinning circles in conversation wasting even more of my time basically just repeating in a million different ways there’s nothing i can do and no way i can help you.So now i have no choice but to be home Thursday and lose out on a day’s worth of money at work or otherwise wait for another 2-3 weeks for the next appointment. Great. And I already had this date booked off specifically for this and lost money by not going to work. Not to mention i live in an area where the connection is so bad for both mobile services and internet that i had to step out on my balcony just to have the conversation with the agent that done nothing for me.They should make you aware from the beginning that the installation process will take a month or so instead of wasting your time and disappointing you when they don’t show up and rescheduled without any notice.I work online as well so the it might not seem like 3 days makes a difference but it does. I’m losing money each and every day because of it.And as i understand the wifi will take another 10 days to settle in after installation… i just pray to god the connection will be better than the service i was given so far…The salesman i spoke to was great very helpful when it came to understanding what I’d get and what I could expect and convincing to boot.

Abusive extortion of loyal customers.,"Abusive extortion of loyal customers.Each year BT will adjust the amount customers pay per month for their plans according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 3.9%!So if the the CPI rate is 2.8%, BT customers’ monthly plan prices increase by 8.1% - in just one year.  You will be PAYING DOUBLE in just 9 years, when the true rate of inflation over that period will be a fraction of that.GREEDY, ARROGANT & EXPLOITATIVE.  AVOID.The dismissive, flippant response below reflects the corporate arrogance of BT. Imposing an ongoing annual price increase of Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 3.9% is not ""fair"" - it's unfair, unreasonable, unjustifiable & extortionate.In terms of BT's misguided belief that it is ""continuing to offer excellent service to our customers"", 89% of Trustpilot reviews clearly disagree.  An introspective corporation in denial.Meanwhile, despite appalling customer service, BT pre-tax profits were £536 million in the 3 months to June 2021 (£2.15bn profit p.a.!)

BT - ‘Beware Trouble’,"We signed up for FTTP with BT earlier in the year, paying more to get a better service. It was OK while it worked. The problem is that now it doesn’t work, we are in our 4th day with no internet or landline. Three estimated fix times have come and gone, now there is no estimated fix time at all! I have rung customer services 3 times, all to no avail. No one is able to tell us what the problem is or when it will be fixed. BT has no concept of what a supplier/customer relationship should be. If a supplier cannot supply the service they have agreed to supply they should be informing the customer of what the problem is and what they are doing to resolve the problem and giving a realistic timescale for the resolution of the problem.BT is a communications company that cannot or will not communicate effectively.Be aware that if you sign up with BT and have a problem you may find yourself feeling abandoned like we do.",Peter ,2021,9,21,1,0.144,0.089,Negative

Poor service from BT,"Poor customer service from BT - I have unbreakable wifi, cloud phone and mobile broadband from BT business. I've had a poor experience all round. Firstly BT started my contract early meaning I incurred extra charges from my previous supply for leaving their contract early. Next the installation was weak - the phone and 4G part of the broadband I was left to setup on my own - just the hub installed. I didn't need to wait in for an engineer - I could have done that myself...Without prompting BT started sending me paper bills at £4 each. BT are overcharging for second handsets for the cloud phone - I bought the same model elsewhere for cheaper, but BT wouldn't allow the phone to be registered on the network - I had to buy a more expensive one from them. I told them where to stick that.I was told that the 4G part of my unbreakable wifi would work well where I am (signal was 4/5), but I've only been able to pick up a 'poor' signal wherever in the house the receiver is.Frankly, the extra cost that I'm paying for BT over my previous provider makes for seriously poor value for money. I would avoid BT, and I will likely be cancelling my unbreakable wifi, and cancelling altogether at the end of my contract.",Adam,2021,9,21,1,0.104,0.026,Negative

A truly awful experience,"The worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. Apparently it's impossible to cancel my subscription. I keep getting charged even though if you go back and listen to all the previous phone calls I have made, I have been assured multiple times that my subscription is cancelled and I will not be billed anymore. I originally signed up for the broadband in July, I was initially so impressed by the man who set up my account and all seemed fine. Then it appears they had my address wrong and the kit was sent to the wrong address, this was then corrected and was sent again to me.When it finally arrived the hybrid connect I purchased which apparently provided internet before your broadband is activated didn't work. I called customer service and was out through to technical support who told me the complete opposite that hybrid connect doesn't work without broadband set up, which makes no logical sense because that is the entire point of the service. I then after all of this nonsense asked to cancel my services and decided to go on SKY instead who have been brilliant. Was told my account would be credited with the money I was charged, this didn't happen as I was told it failed. So once again I had to call BT and ask them to do this, eventually my account was credited and an extra £10 was added on. I asked the advisor to please clarify that my services have been cancelled and I won't be charged for anything else, I was promised this was the case. I check my bank a few weeks later and oh look another £27.80 charge from BT, I immediately cancel my direct debit with my bank and got my money back but then I receive a letter saying I owe £27.80, even though on multiple phone calls which I know are recorded I was told this would not happen. I am now calling customer services once again to get this cancelled and I get cut off mid way through the phone call after I was told I was being transferred. I call back up again and apparently cannot be put through to who I was speaking to before, so once again have to explain everything again. I would never recommend anyone to go on BT and how it can be so hard to cancel and close my account I truly have no idea. My latest call on 20/9/2021 ended with being told that my £27.80 bill has been cancelled and credited to my account and my account will be closed by midnight tonight. I have probably wasted 8 hours of my life on the phone to BT and I hope this is the last call I ever have to make. I am sure the internet is great but as I was never able to get it I have no idea and the company has been absolutely ridiculous.",Mr Hayden Thomas,2021,9,20,1,0.104,0.072,Negative
Poor customer service from BT,"I switched my TV and broadband package from Sky to BT about a month ago.  As part of the switch I ordered an extra TV box.  I tried to place my order online, but the extra box didn’t show.  I telephoned BT to query this and to order the extra box the online order was cancelled and I placed the order with an advisor.  I clearly explained why I was calling and that I wanted to order an extra box.As soon as I became aware that the extra box had not been ordered I telephoned BT to query why, only to be told that I couldn’t order an extra box until the original order had been completed.  I tried to explain that the extra box was part of the original order, but the advisor was adamant that nothing could be done.  As it was clear that I wasn’t getting anywhere I asked for a manager to call me.After waiting weeks, BT called me yesterday, on a Sunday, when it was impossible to take the call.  Checking online, they have rescheduled the call for next Friday (how do they know that’s convenient?).  It will be the best part of a month before I can speak to someone about what is a very simple issue; they have failed to provide a piece of equipment that I ordered.  It’s easy to resolve; apologise and send out the equipment as soon as possible.I know that BT are a big company and that individual customers aren’t really a priority to them, but they need to remember that it’s those customers who are paying them for a service.I don’t use Twitter or Facebook.

The first negative review I've wrote in 32 years.,"This is the first bad review I've actively given besides the odd verbal comment in 32 years, the customer service and situation I have been left in as a BT customer is disgusting.Two nights ago around 10pm I received 3 emails all at once stating my WiFi would be shut off and account closed, a few minutes later the WiFi was off. I called the next day to find out what had happened as I'd never missed a payment and had a package deal through EE, I was informed I'd not payed a £11.13 charge for installation 4 month prior which was confusing, I'd never had an installation as the landline had been in and working for years. How've after looking back I did find the email with the charge so after paying £92 with extra charges I was told I could have the WiFi back on.... Only to then be told my account has been closed anyway, I was then asked to return my hub and that if I wanted to continue with my service I might be given a more expensive plan, I was then told if I wanted to cancel I would have to pay cancellation charges for the remainder of my contract which was 18 months. After trying to explain I didn't want to cancel my contract you cancelled on me and that I wanted it to keep working as before I was then told to call back tomorrow afternoon sometime around 3pm and speak to the sales team.The conversation the next day turned out to be a positive one with the customer service person saying i can start a new contract exactly the same as the old one and have you up and running straight away, wait 10 minutes for a confirmation email then that's everything...The email informed me that I was being charged another £40 connection charge, £9.95 delivery for a new hub which would arrive in 11 days, as someone who works from home my business cannot function without using the internet and while still being charged for an account that I've never missed a payment on and still having the original hub plugged in flashing purple I'm left feeling utterly defeated and unable to earn a living.Again this is the first negative review I have ever left but it took a mighty difficult situation to do so, apologies if I've waffled on but this company is horrendous.

BT promised us a seamless transition to…,"BT promised us a seamless transition to full fibre. So far:- Both our household phone and broadband together with my business phone and broadband cut off.- I tried asking whether the business service could be reconnected (it wasn't meant to be part of the ""seamless transition"" deal in the first place).- Answer from the domestic help line - nope nothing to do with us, have to go through the business department and they are too busy to answer the phone. (even though domestic department cut it off- no accountability). Fixed 48 hours later but team did nothing about domestic broadband issues.-. We still have not got any connection for phone and broadband on household service - apparently someone might turn up late next week - (over a week with no wifi or landline now)- rubbish!!Thanks for the reply Paddy. I have contacted you through BT Facebook proposing you might chose to deploy an engineer to reconnect broadband and landline sooner rather than later. I am in tomorrow if that helps -  disconnected 8 days and counting.Poor Paddy and Matt couldn't help - wrong departments - the saga continues..Day 9 - It will cost us £80 plus to cancel the non existent service apparently. The good news though is that an Engineer will give us an update call on Monday (Day 11) I've taken to giving helpful tips like maybe reconnect us on the copper service for now. Will update tomorrow.Day 10 - Anne L from BT UK Customer service can see/understand our issues and agrees decent level of compensation is likely to be warranted (rather than having to pay our way out of BT's mistakes) - hooray! But still no progress possible until tomorrow (Day11) and the promised call back from the Engineers who cut us off 11 days ago but are unable  to reconnect us promptly.Day 11 - Apparently somebody has phoned somebody else and the issue has been ""escalated"" for another update on Wednesday = Day 13.Day 12 - The engineers rang. Have we closed our account? Nope not for £80 plus for the privilege we explained. They are coming around on Thursday = Day 14. Apparently BT have been trying to ring our domestic landline to contact us - but they cut it off??Day 14 (yesterday) A very nice engineer from Openreach turned up and checked the issue....which was that the fibre had never been connected up properly 14 days ago! Great relief we have a phone and WIFI back now but then the compensation. Initially Michael had some maths issues - £5 for 8 days right? Had to threaten to put phone down on him and escalate before finally general agreement that since BT cut us off completely for 14 days the maths was in fact £8 x 14. We have other issues outstanding with BT - we are not getting any Billing info sent to us, we were hard sold two SIMs for mobiles which were also meant to be seamless but aren't but we can't stop them or someone in the mobile dept will shout at us and so on and so forth.

bt.com greedy & unprofessional,"What a pathetic company. I have moved home three times in the last 20 months because of landlords selling properties, due to Corvid, to keep their private businesses afloat. When I moved in to the first property BT was the only company permitted to add a telephone line into the building. Within nine months my landlord had to sell his property I was fortunate to move directly one floor above. You would think this was a simple mother for British telecom. Simply connect one box to another not a chance. BT open reach got involved and the last me for six weeks without any telephone Internet our services because they are totally Incapable of discussing with the customer their actual needs i’m sorting it out the end. Unfortunately, I had to vacate my second flat yet again due to Covid and the landlord is selling up. I moved to new property and despite being with BT for over 18 months and the shambolic idiotic failure to sort out my broadband Internet for nearly 6 weeks they have now despicably asked for £54 as an early termination fee.Bt.com if you wore capable and able to promise 100% that there would be no issues with this new move, which you couldn’t, I would’ve took you with me. But who in their right mind would ever take a company that can’t get the basics correct. I will reluctantly have to pay this charge but I feel it is totally unfair that people who rent and may have to move due to no fault of their own choosing have to pay early termination charges with the likes of BT and other suppliers.

Things was great at fist of an offer of £28 but that price crept up quickly before my 24mths was up to £42.21.Over the last month signal at night haa been so bad on my upstairs smart tv! I complained about this and nothing was really done? This continued to happen and i would complain? Last CS tried to blame how it must be my LED lights on my tv? It must be a problem with my tv and how is it i can use wifi on my phone then then that means there nothing wrong? Matt was convinced it was my tv that was the issue? My tv is fine and its only around a certain time of night that the wifi plays up. You only have to go on twitter to see the complaints about the wifi? Its funny as matt beiny CS did not offer my a device to my make my wifi stronger? Instead blamed my tv? I didnt even feel helped other than he checked the speed which did not reflect how my tv was working in real time? And my tv was clearly showing not connected to too the internet? Matt also thinks that a tv and a phone works in the same way as i was on my mobile on the internet and a tv streaming media.Ive got too say one of the worst CS interactions ive had. When you paying for a service you want the best service. Of course blips will happen but over a month of raising it since 6th august.Update: 13th Sep 21I can assure you my TV is NOT the issue and LED lights. Took light off again today and watching you tube fine then all of a sudden buffering about 30 mins ago as usually at night?Upon talking to someone on the phone today and can i just say she was lovely and pleasant she told me that twitter CS are not trained too diagnose issue and are meant to pass customers on to a team on the phone who can look further? Also to help get equipment for better connection?Which was never done! Never once was it suggested my issue could have black spots in the house (instead of blaming tvs 🙄) it was also told to me today how an engineer could of been sent to check equipment in the house 🤔 But on all my connection was updated to 5GHZ by matt and he never explained why he was doing it? Or any information? It was only in the morning every device in my house had beem log out because of this new connection? To my surprise this was the first i new about it? I then has to google what this added connection of 5GHZ was because i was not given any information on matt who told me he was a telecoms engineer for 25 years? Needless to say the new connection is as crap as the orginal one buffering what i watch? You only have to go onto twitter to see the complaints of the same nature so thankfully my contract ended a few months ago and now my area provides more options as i had no choice 2 years ago bcos its a new build i will be leaving BT as your service for the price people pay! My grandads saying was you get what you pay for but on this occassion it seems you just want people to pay even more as £42.21 for broadband certaintly is not cheap! Also asking people to message twitter? Why not advise people to put in a complaint to investigate further via email or telephone?

Diabolical Service.,"Long-time customers, when we started a contract BT was the only option.We have had copper 'broad band' internet speeds of less than 3mbps since we moved to this house, almost 15 years ago. We were BT phone customers at other addresses before. Last year fibre broadband was rolled out to houses in the street, our next door neighbours (either side) both have more than 140mbps capability. Apparently, our house cannot have fast broadband as there is an 'anomaly' on their system (?). BT customer services could not explain what the anomaly was but promised to get to the root of the issue and contact us. They told us it would not be quick, probably three months (??) but they would contact us. One year on and still no response. Useless.This is added to all the years they told us fibre would be with us ""next year"".Every other house in the road can have faster broadband, just not ours. BT have failed every time we have contacted them to explain why we cannot have fast broadband when the houses either side of us can.Incidentally, a neighbour a few doors down the road started a fast broadband contract for speeds of around 85mbps, but they only get 30-35mbps. Very typical of BT, over promising, under delivering. We've given up with BT, 'pleading' to buy a product (that others take for granted) from a company is bad enough, when it's support is as bad as BT's it's time to leave them behind.Do yourself a favour, avoid our experience and try elsewhere.15/9/21The reply to this is typical of a social media fob-off. What do they believe we have been doing over the past years?

Lies about broadband speeds and fake guarantees,"I pay for 500mbps but get nothing close to that most of the time.My contract states that there is a ""Stay Fast Guarantee"" of 250Mbps but I rarely get that. My desktop with a gigabit LAN port is hardwired to my router using high quality CAT6 ethernet cable but still do not receive the advertised speeds.According to my contract, when my internet speed is lower than the ""guaranteed"" speed I'm due £20 compensation - but the catch is only BT's own internal speed test is considered for this!None of the 3rd party speed tests I use return the seemingly perfect results that BT's own speed test returns. I wonder why that is!And when I open a complaint into this I get one brief response brushing off my complaint, then they close the complaint down at their end and email me to say ""we're pleased we could help.""I won't be renewing with this fraudulent company that clearly detests their own customers.",Richard,2021,9,9,1,0.1,0.109,Positive

After phoning BT, even though I was an existing customer, they matched the offer and I was happy to sign a new 24 month contract!- BT TV - flexible so I can upgrade and downgrade whenever I want. It is perfect!- BT TV  - I keep the equipment after the contract. It is not 'loaned' to me like Sky. Other than significantly reducing the long term cost, I don't have to worry about Sky fining me if I don't return 'their' equipment!- the lovely BT customer service rep just phoned me up, saying a new 3 month offer was on the BT TV to remove £8 a month off the price! I wasn't even aware of it!!This is by far the best customer service I have ever had when renewing internet or purchasing TV packages! It's a shame I can't give BT more than 5 stars!I am cancelling Sky now (even though I have been with them 2 years) because they won't even come close to matching a Sky offer I saw online.

Will leave you without internet for weeks for no reason,"EDIT: Further warning to anyone thinking of going with BT. They will perform hard credit searches on you, EVEN IF YOU DO NOT SIGN A CONTRACT!! This will affect your credit score significantly!!!Edit: BT have now agreed these searches were wrongfully requested and removed them.I was moving house to a place that had BT as a provider. I figured the easiest thing was just to go with them to streamline it and get internet as fast as possible. However, their sales team told me that, even though they were the existing provider, I would have to wait two weeks without internet. As they explained it, someone would have to come to the house to disconnect the internet when we moved in, then wait two weeks and install exactly the same internet from scratch, with a hefty fee. When I asked why they would do this rather than just let us take over the existing line. They just said ""policy"". This company is so bad, they can't even sell you internet when you are begging to be connected!!!Edit: As expected, even in response they don't understand what I am saying. I have called three other providers and had it from their own technicians that while there is a two week notice period to take over a line, the cease does not and should not be kept on! The fact they can't understand this and refuse to remove it even when their own technicians say they have no idea why they have done it this way shows most of their staff are totally incompetent.Edit: BT are continuing to block my line even after all accoutns have been stopped. they are effectively trying to blackmail me into taking their services. Confirmed with Ofcom this activity is illegal. They only did this after I told them I required broadband for home working.

BT: making life complicated,"Full marks to BT for making the simplest of matters a frustrating waste of time. Following a family bereavement I contacted BT to have the phone line disconnected, a date was agreed, and BT informed me that they would send a return envelope for the BT hub which needed to be returned when the phone was disconnected. Now I would assume that 'when the phone was disconnected' meant that the return envelope would be sent prior to the date of disconnection not at some vague date afterwards at the whim of BT. Logic would tell you that, if a date has been set for disconnection, the chances of somebody being in the property afterwards are pretty slim. Needless to say, the return envelope did not arrive even when BT had been informed at least two weeks in advance of the date for disconnection. And I am now 7000 miles away in my own home, all mail has been redirected and most likely the elusive return envelope is now winging its way to South East Asia. Nevertheless, I contacted a UK neighbour close by who agreed to keep the equipment, and I then contacted BT to explain what had happened, and where precisely they could send a new return envelope. First email communication: rejected by BT (we don't reply to this address even though we write to you from it), second email communication and third email communication (we don't deal with this issue, suggest you phone or try the chat). So off I go to the BT website: sorry, you can't access the chat or access BT log-in because you don't have an account. That's right, because I disconnected the phone - which is what I want to talk to you about. Obviously, BT don't want to talk to anybody unless they have an account. Perhaps I should just spend a heap of money calling them from the other side of the world to repeat what I have already repeated in three emails none of which have received a response. Hidden deep within the internet, however, were two email addresses of actual human beings who are the CEO and the individual at the head of customer services. So far, so good, that email (now the fourth) hasn't bounced back, nor have I received a message from the CEO telling me that it has nothing to do with him. I note that BT has responded to all of the comments on Trustpilot. Therefore, BT will no doubt read these remarks, and I will feel satisfied that I have done everything I can to deal with this because, rest assured, I am doing no more.",Alan Crombie,2021,9,7,1,0.039,0.054,Positive

I asked them why did they not inform me back in 2019 when my old contract had expired and also why they had not reduce the monthly amount back to a sim only contract which was only £10 and why they continued to charge me for the phone even when the phone was paid off . The lady said I can see your point of view but its in the terms and conditions. Any thing you buy  whether its a house ,car, TV anything, at the end of the contract you pay nothing .

My stay fast guarantee is 10mbps…. 10mbps, when you look at the average speed in the U.K it is 50mbps but BT claim 10mbps is “staying fast” which is quite obviously a lie; I don’t know anyone that would claim being 1/5th of the AVERAGE speed is FAST but apparently it’s okay for BT to claim and not have trading standards investigate this misleading and false wording.A terrible service, terrible customer service, terrible company.

Listening to BT wait- time music 3hours…,"0800 800 150. I'm on my mobile 'phone listening to the awful BT on-hold music, and worse still, it's distorted though my 'phone's speaker,  so it sounds like the music is playing under water, beneath crashing waves. It's the kind of noise that would warble out of a tannoy system in hell to torture the souls of the damned! I'd call BT on the landline but the landline's reception is worse still, and anyway the allegedly unfixable landline, which crackles and fades to the point the caller's voice becomes inaudible, and has done so for decades, is another BT saga. No, this story today is about my home hub delivery that BT repeatedly dispatches to the wrong address.Gratefully, this week, I've only notched up three hours of conversation with BT call centre staff,  interspaced with wobbly wait music,  (and that's relatively low time wasting ) while, predictably, yet another employee in BT f**ks up again and again...and so it goes... on and on. I swear I do try to be respectful and polite to them. You see, my problem is that BT can't send a home hub to my correct home address despite my paying them 60+£ per month for the service. Six weeks , after placing my order, I'm still making 0800 800 150 'phone calls and repeating my delivery details to different staff.Back to the current call. The music has finished and I'm now repeating my postcode to yet another  BT guy, who pretends he suffers from chronic dyslexia, as once again, he asks me for my delivery details. This is  the FITH time today he's done this.  Dear readers, at this point, some of you must be wondering, do I perhaps have a speech impediment? I assure you that I do not.So, could it be that my house is difficult to find? Nope. Amazon deliver here , as do Royal Mail, regularly, and they have zero problem in comprehending where I live, proving you don't need  a brain like Alan Turing's to decrypt my location from my delivery details . This is agony! The BT call centre worker is now pretending to be a complete idiot; he must be playacting, because for the SIXTH time during our conversation, he's asked me for my home address and postcode and when I double-check to see if he's entered it correctly, he keeps getting it wrongNow, here's the thing these call centre workers can't be this stupid, and I have gradually come to believe, over hours of conversations  with many different , seemingly incompetent, clueless BT workers, that they are in fact bored, and they are taking out their workplace frustration on their customers.Or, it could be that BT staff are rather cunning, and it's an attempt to drive me to utter exasperation. So, what do they expect me to do? Maybe, that I drive the 50 mile round trip to the wrong delivery address and retrieve my home hub, along with all the rest of the hubs they claim to have sent there? Perhaps I will  kindly take these other misdirected home hubs to the nearest post office and post them back to BT? Well I'm not doing that.Whatever the reason, here's a curious BT organizational/behavioural rule: ask BT call centre workers to perform a simple task (like correct a wrong delivery address), and their staff will invariably do the opposite of what you request. This apparent problem with simple comprehension and retention of information, could be organizational and systemic, and, if it's not a cunning strategy, then I suggest that it has it origins partly in human nature which experiences working for BT as soul- crushing call centre boredom, and partly in how BT as an organization demoralizes and dehumanizes their call centre staff, because as I wrote, human beings individually can't be this stupid... because otherwise they would require support and care workers to help manage their daily lives.Wasting a precious hour writing this? Nope. Good practice for the full and edited MSM article. Gruniad stuff-of it is.And, please do ignore this John 'bot's' replies, it's all bulls***t. If I contact BT on his advice, I'll be chatting to maybe three more people again, for another hour, none of whom will be able to correctly take down my address details. Why should I waste yet another precious hour even attempting to get any sense out of them? Oh, and many thanks for the 'direct' links to your helping colleagues on Facebook and Twitter, John. Of course, the Facebook link just takes me to the generic BT page, and I'd have to spend hours searching for the right person. Good laugh for you guys, but then, I've come to imagine one section of hell is probably a giant, pointless call centre, just like BT. And one consolation, I'm not the one trapped inside it.Update. 3 Days later : Despite hours on the 'phone to BT call centre staff, and numerous promises from them, did the home hub ever arrive, at my address? Of course it didn't! I didn't expect it to. Soon it's going to be 2 months, £140.00, and no service.",andrew barnett,2021,9,2,1,0.126,0.079,Negative
TO NEIL AND ROBBIE AT BT,"Do your bosses know just what your customers are going through, or are you paid to just try and make them happy by posting a reply. No wonder BT are losing customers at 125k per quarter, using the old copper lines that were put in before your parents were even born, and expect it to carry data is a joke.

BT UPGRADE TO FIBRE 900,"So just recently booked in and had fibre 900 installed. Fantastic right, not for us. Engineer arrived 3 hours past the time so waited in all day and had a time slot for nothing. Once arrived he fitted and explained we should have a new hub, this is the smart hub 2 which we already had. We was told when we upgraded that we already had the equipment so they won't need to send out equipment. When I rang them to tell them the engineer said we needed a new hub. The lady quickly told me that we had the correct hub. Anyway installed and left and we was still only receiving our old service off 45mps. When contacted again to bt. They told me that it can take up to midnight for services to go active. As soon as phone disconnected, we lost all Internet connection. Called the next day and went through to technical. Explained what the engineer had said and done. Explained he said we needed the newest hub for it to work. She then said that she wished engineers didn't interfere and that we have the latest hub and that's not the problem and she will send out engineer. Engineer arrived today, onetime. He straight away said we had the wrong hub and that's why it's not working. Now to get this right. There are two types of bts smart hub 2. They both look exactly the same however one has a red wan port on the back. If yours doesn't have this. Then insist bt needs to send you a new hub because otherwise you'll be without Internet like me. They are now sending me a new hub however if they knew their own equipment in the first place I wouldn't be left without Internet. As we all know Internet runs everything now. I have 3 children, no sky, no cctv working because it uses Internet. I wished they listened in the first instance and just sent me out the correct box needed for this new fast Internet they provide. They did offer me £20 as compensation however the missed appointment alone should be £26 according to their own website. Plus loss of service plus compensation. I just hope when this new box comes. It works ? I must say previously we have had no problems with bt. Just wish they listened to customers telling them what their engineers relay. Maybe we would of got Internet back on sooner. Just be sure if your upgrading to the new fast fibre,that you have the correct smart hub2 with the red wan port on the back and this can be all avoided**UPDATE**So I contacted you like you asked via Facebook. However after speaking with ""Garry"" he is denying to talk to me regarding the account saying that I'm not on there as a listed person. I have been speaking to you for the last year and I'm defiantly on the account.you even send me texts and emails.  I even just phoned in to double check and they confirmed that I'm on the account. I have never really experienced any problems with bt, but maybe people on trust pilot are right that when you have a problem with bt, you are not willing to sort it out.",Karl Aaron King,2021,9,2,2,0.04,0.047,Positive

So what’s the point in that? Only reason I took out your broadband was because of your promising fast WiFi which I have never had!

Just moved to another provider,"Just moved to another provider - finally given up with BT with whom I have tried to be patient for some years.About four weeks ago we started having real trouble with Broadband. We live in a coastal village in Lincolnshire and it has been tolerable for some time. Suddenly in our area there have been countless problems. We can't get fibre as this has been retricted so far to towns and cities. That said, for the eight years we have been here we have managed to get by. My previous BT problem was with their accounts and the fact that they made one payment agreement with me but kept taking about twice as much from my account. Sorted that but now I have been spending hours of my unpaid time - I am a professional writer for for numerous regional, national and international publications - trying to see what is wrong now with our telephone. It went wrong a week ago. Callers are told that we are speaking on the line. We were not. Various calls to BY resulted in promises that were not kept, attempts at getting us to spend more with them and so on.Phone still off, Broadband goes missing several times a day. So, had enough and wasted more time trying to find someone else who might make sense. Not easy, settled for EE which probably means that ultimately I am still paying BT.BT seems to have an illegal monopoly on the national telephone system. Does anyone care?

Engineer reported that WiFi signal was poor in our lounge which is next to our study and approximately 3 metres away. He suggested we need a new hub as old one was not good for the service we are paying for.

BT were unable to offer viable broadband to my property,"I signed up for BT FTP Broadband.The information video told me to choose where I wanted the new box and to clear the area for the engineer to work; that a hole would be drilled through my wall and a new box be placed outside and inside.  I chose an area and cleared around the existing TV. The engineer turned up but couldn't work out how to get the cable from the telegraph pole on the front of the house to the living room on the back of the house so he left...I received a text from BT that I needed to rebook my appointment because they hadn't been able to access the property...  I called BT and explained the situation and they said that that was a contractor so they would said an Openreach Engineer.  Apparently I didn't need the boxes to come through to my living room at all.  They could fit the boxes near to my front door, put the router in a cupboard in the kitchen, and use some devices which plug into mains sockets instead of ethernet for my TV.  A second appointment was booked and I cleared out my nominated kitchen cupboard and waited in all day, but no one turned up...I called BT who said that the appointment was booked on the BT system but hadn't been sent to Openreach.  Another appointment was offered, however as a teacher I couldn't accept it because it was during term time.  The advisor said that he would pay extra for an urgent appointment once I had justified why I needed it.The Openreach engineer turned up today and advised that I needed two available power sockets in my kitchen cupboard and that he was concerned to drill through the render on the front of my house due to a decent chance of damage.  Also the fibre installation should not be close to water and my water meter, dishwasher and boiler are all in a line along the wall which I had nominated.  The engineer said that I could organise work to have a cable fitted from my living room through the loft and then drill through the front wall of my house and then rebook another appointment... this might involve the need to replaster and redecorate internal walls and risk damaging the external render... I called BT who said that that was that... also that there was no way to increase my current speed of 4mb (although this keeps cutting out) on the other option of FTPC.Basically wasted 3 days hanging around and 2 days disrupted waiting for deliveries of kit to no avail.  Some days I cannot even stream the radio and we can't steam a movie reliably after 9pm.  Forget playing in tournaments on the Nintendo or video calling for work.

Diabolical experience in switching suppliers,"After getting fed up with plusnet (bt's sister company) because of their awful customer service and poor internet connection which drops out constantly which was making it difficult for me to work from home, we did a bit of research and decided to switch to bt. What a diabolical experience that turned out to be. When I first called them to say I was thinking about switching it sounded like it would be so easy and such a positive experience. Nothing could be further from the truth. They said it would happen the same day, it could be in as little as half an hour. It took three and a half days to get my internet up and running. How embarrassing in this day and age and what a mis-sell. Every time you phone and speak to an agent, they follow a script and have to run a fault check. You try and tell them it has already been done by the previous five people you've spoken to over the last couple of days - there is no fault - yet they carry on with their script anyway to the point of making you scream. I mean IS IT NOT TIME YOU CHANGED YOUR SCRIPT BT SO THAT YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICES TEAM DON'T ALL SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF ROBOTS?!?!?! Rather than telling new customers the switch could be so quick, you should be telling them there could be problems and it could take DAYS so that they could at least be prepared. I had to buy extra data for my mobile phone and use it as a tether so that I could still be online and work. What one agent says doesn't support what another one says. As one agent quite rightly told me there are thousands of them in the call centre, it just depends on who you get.  As we suspected all along, an engineer did have to come out and the problem turned out to be in the green box about 400 yards away from our house - they'd screwed up there and hadn't connected us properly or something. On a positive note our broadband is so much better (faster) and doesn't cut out but it isn't cheap. They also refunded us for the two days they weren't able to fix our problem but shouldn't that have been for three and a half days?  Would that have made a huge dent in their profits? I don't think so. So think twice before you switch, do your research and be prepared for the worst. Sadly, even if they gave me free broadband for the next twelve months it probably wouldn't make up for the frustration and disappointment they caused us.",bumblebee,2021,8,30,1,0.102,0.058,Negative

I was very patient with them the first 5 times I had to call in but the amount of time I’ve wasted is an absolute joke. It’s shocking that a company as big as BT can fix simple issues within a few days.

BT; How do your customer facing staff not know you have a complaints process?,"BT I’m intrigued to know how a company your size doesn’t have a complaints dept or even more concerning a complaints process. According to your staff ‘ ALL OF OUR ADVISORS ARE A COMPLAINTS TEAM’ I imagine that’s why after speaking to 3 previous advisors of yours who have ALL INDIVIDUALLY promised me over the last 6 weeks they will refund MY MONEY to me (which you’ve taken after I cancelled BT Sports back in March) they’ve all investigated their own ‘complaints’ and this is why it’s still not been returned. To then be told by a 4th person today they will be closing my ‘complaint’ (because he’s a complaint handler and because he’s again supposedly refunding my money) that means I don’t have a complaint anymore. BT; your staff DON’T KNOW YOUR OWN COMPLAINT PROCEDURE, isn’t it a requirement of your regulator that staff should be able to at least signpost to your complaints process? Isn’t that the room 101 of customer service? I’ve told your advisor I want to make a complaint which is that I’ve spoken to 3 different advisors who have not followed through with an action, although I want my money refunded the complaint is the lack of action by your staff. Your 4th advisor today does not understand this, extremely frustrating conversation with him. He even then said to me ‘what do you want me to do then, take the money back’ I’m then told when he does eventually find that you do have a complaints process that I have to put it in writing!

Another one star review for a truly…,"Another one star review for a truly useless company. I have two lines, one exclusively for broadband, the other for my landline. The landline is crackly so early July I reported the fault. They sent Openreach out but on arrival they told me they’d been given the broadband line number to repair and weren’t allowed to touch the landline. I arranged another repair visit two days later. Same story - couldn’t repair landline, they’d been given bb line number. The Openreach engineer spoke to BT from my house and arranged a further visit two days later. Friday comes - no engineer visit. I did Live Chat to ask - no, beg, for a visit from an engineer, to repair the correct number. I was assured, absolutely assured, the engineer would come, and would repair the right number. Guess what happened next? Go on, have a guess.. yes, you win star prize, the engineer came and said he couldn’t touch the landline, he’d got the broadband line to repair. The non faulty, fully working line. I again arranged a repair, then got an email saying the landline had been fixed without a visit to my house. Now, like most people, I rarely use my landline, so I lifted the phone, it sounded ok, I carried on with my exciting life. Monday this week, I used the phone to make a call. And the fault is still there, as bad as ever. I could barely make out what the person was saying, the crackling was so loud.  So I called BT again. I explained what had happened and the advisor told me he would make a special note of the confusion to ensure the correct number was repaired. Yesterday the engineer came and you know what I’m going to say, don’t you? So I am now waiting on yet another visit from the engineer. Although, laughably, I got a text this morning saying there was no fault showing and I had to confirm if there’s still a fault, which I have now done. So I’ve had 2 useless visits, a no-show, a useless visit, a remote repair that didn’t work, a useless visit and now I’m waiting to see what happens next. Yesterday I emailed the Chief Execs office directly but unsurprisingly, I’ve had no response to that. My contract runs out in January and I’m off, after being a customer since 1986. Dire, dire, dire.Update: have just had contact from the Chief Execs office. They say they will contact me within 48 hours to help. We’ll see.Further update: have just been contacted directly and now have a case worker from the Complaints Team to make sure this gets sorted. The caseworker was excellent and - fingers crossed - I’m having an engineer booked in for next week and will get this sorted.Further update: The Complaints Team were brilliant. Lauren took control of the situation, rang midweek to ensure everything was being dealt with, and rang on Saturday to check all was working properly. I got an engineer from Openreach who systematically followed the copper wire until he found the fault. I now have a fully working line, and a decent compensation amount to make up for the many hassles I’ve faced. Sadly for BT I will still move my Broadband custom elsewhere in January as the failure of Openreach to offer fibre means I will never get a decent signal. But I give credit where it’s due, my landline works now thanks to the help I got from BT Complaints team. I would upgrade my rating to 4 stars.",Trentmum,2021,8,27,1,0.118,0.122,Positive
1 is being generous!!!,"1 is being generous!!!I moved out of my flat and had an absolute nightmare sorting out my services for my new house, a task that seems so easy right? Think again when it comes to these fools.Not only should it have been a very quick change of address on my account, they actually decided to start a new account in my name which cause confusion calling the whole time and giving an old account number instead of the new one which was never given to me. The other challenge was telling them that I was yet to move into my new house and that I was currently staying at my girlfriend’s mum’s house for the interim which caused BT to crumble apart and found it impossible to send my new tv kit and smart hub to this address (again, seems so easy to understand right?). After about 9 calls in the space of one week to BT I still haven’t received my hub and tv kit as they’ve sent it from my old flat address to my new house address where no one is living!

The issue suddenly stopped and when I checked on my business online portal it said it was fixed. It had no explanations as to why the system failed and then came back online with no intervention. I spent about 2 hours on the phone talking to engineers and was offered a £60 rebate for the loss of service. The engineer was booked for the next day and based on the advice he would not attend if it was fixed. He did attend, replaced the modem and the system then failed again for 3 hours the next day. He said it was working and left the site without checking.This was then fixed by BT after yet another call.

One Special Member Of BT!,"This is for one lady, whom BT have working within their team, somewhere out there, who took over when a catalogue of disasters seemed to take over my home move. If it weren't for her, this would be the usual One Star, and totally negative, but she managed my case, once BT had cancelled my order four times! I should, as per my other reviews, say that it was Open Reach, actually, that seemed to cancel jobs, but it was BT that cancelled orders, so they were and are at fault! What I really want to say, is that the various managers who promised call backs to me, and there were two, need sacking! As they did not call me back, despite scheduled call backs promised. I was also led up the garden path regarding sales, and I am sure it is because the sales side earn commission, and thus start a new order, on the hope they will clinch the deal, and the cash! Something went wrong here, but this is about one woman, who saved the day (or five weeks, actually!) and did all she could, and more! So, to BT, if you can find her, promote her, and deal with the ones who give you a bad name, as your staff are not all bad.",BlueSky,2021,8,23,5,0.134,0.094,Negative
Beyond Pathetic,"Several weeks ago my grandmothers digital voice stopped working - she could make outgoing calls (and her emergency pendant would work) She was in hospital at the time, and because of other issues at the time we didn’t rush to phone BT since she could make outgoing calls. However after a couple weeks I phoned BT. I was given lots of different reasons for the problem from lots of different people from all over the UK, who promised us it would be fixed “within 48 hours”, “it will be sorted tomorrow”.Long story short they cancelled her phone service and promised to reinstate it right after - this didn’t happen. Now a 96 year old has been left completely without a phone service for what will be over a week, IF it goes back on when they promised it will - I’m not holding my breath. It’s beyond pathetic a 96 year old is left without this lifeline - her only method of communication to family during the pandemic and most important her only way of contacting us if she fell which has happened more often in recent years. Ironically, I was planning to join BT after having problems with my own broadband provider. This experience has taught me not to go near them!PS: I’ve spent approx. 6 hours on the phone with BT the past couple weeks..!",Order 522827,2021,8,22,1,0.067,0.072,Positive

As the router didn't start to work by the end of the day I rang BT who now tell me Openreach will have to send an engineer to sort out the pole fittings outside my house, and it could take up  to two weeks for a visit. They can let me know what date they can try to fix it on in four days time. How can an organisation sell a service they haven't actually got laid on - and then take weeks to put right their error?

BT argue that they told us that we could add a voice bundle but I dont recall this conversation. They sent us our Contract by email and yes it stated PAYG for voicecalls but it didnt register at the time what this meant. I have never had a PAYG phone before only Contract. When I called today to query the £78 voicecall bill they argued that we knew about this. Hand on my heart we did not. It hadnt registered when we renewed our Contract. Feel totally let down by BT.

The Best Compensation in the World ? NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH BT ever again !!,"BT is the worst company I have dealt with in 45years in Business. We have finally left BT after a long trail of incompetence and mis selling. Their answer is not to resolve the problem, it is is to put you into the BT complaints resolution process. This can take years! Emails are not answered , phone calls are put on hold  and then cut off. No two people can tell the same story! If this was anyone else it would be Fraud. We were mis sold a phone system by BT. in 2020. We spent several months complaining, eventually they admitted they had mis sold the system. - They credited all or some of the cost of the system, It is very difficult to know as BT invoicing is incomprehensible -- and who has the time to spend many hours (unpaid) on the phone to BT to get the run-around, they virtually never return calls. We bought a system that did work in a very simple process from Signal Telecom in Stokesley. It does everything we asked for and costs far less. Bt response is to offer verbal apologies To cancel the services We no longer want from them (at no charge to us) and to offer a £1000 credit against future bills. Most of the internet scams we are experiencing at the moment are based around BT Billing, perhaps BT would like to fix this? BT are a disgrace, why can they charge customers as they please when the service is inadequate.  The Phone lines to our site are in terrible disrepair but BT will not spend the money to upgrade them. The biggest compensation we have received is that we no longer have to deal with BT !!

I’ve had to set up another account - the 5th since May which I’m only doing to have internet through the connecting hub and I’m leaving to go to Virgin (account already set up with Virgin, can’t wait to get rid of BT!. I was supposed to have received a cheque for my compensation, still waiting and because the account is closed nobody can see if it’s been sent out.

Unreliable and not helpful,"Swapped to BT as previously with talk talk for 15 years, thinking we might get a bit faster WiFi.We have been with BT 6 months and it is terrible. Far slower than our previous broadband.Every month we attempt to set up a direct debit to pay but Bt don’t actually do it then cut our WiFi off a day after the bill is not paid and then try and charge us a reconnection fee although they were the ones not setting it up. It happens every month, they then tried to say it was the bank not giving authorisation after 5 months, even though they have never said this was the problem previously to which they had plenty of opportunities to explain.The signal fails every few days which means that all our devices disconnect and don’t reconnect when it comes back on and I have to reconnect it manually every few days which is rather irritating. We bought a box to connect to our router that should kick in and cover low signal periods from BT to stop this happening but this also doesn’t work as the broadband fails and devices still disconnect.When streaming anything it buffers almost every time or the picture is bad. Customer service is pretty challenging and whenever there is problem which is all the time it’s not their fault or try to sell us something else to help their poor service. I’m really disappointed as I imagined BT to be very good. I never had to call my previous provider and I have learnt my lesson that the grass is not always greener.As soon as our contract is up we will be returning to my previous broadband provider who were cheaper and very reliable.Edit- the only positive thing I can say is that once our service completely stopped as there was probably with a cable up the road somewhere and the engineer that visited was lovely and really appeared to know what he was doing, his communication skills were very good.",Em,2021,8,11,1,0.127,0.091,Negative

Shockingly appalling service,"My family and I moved to the UK in early July. We chose BT as our broadband provider, but after multiple delays and customer service so poor it boggles the mind, we pulled the plug and went with Virgin instead. We were given multiple dates when our service would begin. Then when it did not, we would call and learn from a representative that our broadband service had been delayed. (Various excuses were given.) That in the 21st century a huge company like BT would not notify us — by email, text, or phone — that a crucial service was not being delivered as promised unless we called them, waited on the line and directly asked about it: shameful. They tend to push blame onto Openreach. When two techs from Openreach finally came, they stood there shaking their heads and told us they did not know why they were sent to our rental house, as they 'do work underground' and our installation involved fibres and cables that were above ground. They said they were not authorised to climb poles. When we called BT, the representative claimed to have no knowledge of this visit or the issue the Openreach techs were referencing. The rep insisted that we still needed to wait for Openreach to do its job before we could get service. This surreal passing of the buck seems to be standard operating procedure for BT.Even more appalling than BT's delays and work ethic is their actual customer service. They seem to be trained to apologise profusely (most of the representatives were very nice and extremely apologetic) without doing or saying anything proactive or useful to the customer. The final straw was when we — in utter frustration — said we wanted to cancel our order after being without Wifi in a new country for a month and counting, with no indication this frustrating cycle would end anytime soon. (I learned from other Trustpilot reviews that this is not an uncommon experience, and could drag on for many months.) The rep curtly said that he would cancel the order. When my husband then asked him if he thought we were receiving acceptable service — the multiple delays, the visit from Openreach in which they told us they had no business servicing our house, the lack of communication from BT about our account, etc — the representative insisted quite strongly that he WAS providing us the service we asked for ... in that he was agreeing to cancel our family's Wifi entire order as we had asked him 45 seconds earlier! This is customer service at its poorest. The real shame is that I've heard BT broadband is very high quality, but after this experience I would warn any potential BT customers to run away as fast as possible and choose a provider with at least half-decent customer service.",Unhappy Mama,2021,8,8,1,0.115,0.064,Negative

This wasn't noticed by us until our garage flooded a few weeks later.  We have sent in photos etc however BT have just given us the number for Openreach and have told us to contact them ourselves.  We have done however Openreach will not reply to our emails or voicemails.  So, we ordered our fibre through BT, our contract is with BT and we pay BT, but they will not sort the problem out.  The communication between BT and Openreach is appalling  and it is the reason we had to wait nearly a year for our fibre to be connected in the first place. Dreadful!07.08.21I did what the gentleman from BT advised in his reply to my review.  I contacted BT through Facebook and I was told that Openreach will not discuss the matter with BT and that we have to contact Openreach ourselves. Nothing I hadn't already been told. BT have done next to nothing to help us with this matter and yet they continue to take our money",KERRY MCCULLOCH,2021,8,4,1,0.068,0.02,Negative
Wish I had not bothered to go to BT.,"From the first contact over a month ago to now has been nothing but false promises first in getting Fibre installed to porting my old phone number over. Was promised by a salesperson that I could port over my existing BT phone number on the same day that broadband was enabled, wrong. Installation day came with two engineers from a sub contractor who had not bothered to read the order and failed to bring a hoist, they left but fortunately an Openreach engineer came to survey two days later and he called for a hoist and I was connected the same day. Rang customer misservices the same day to port the phone number over and was twice told it had been done, that was 3 weeks ago. Since then I have been given 3 different promises that the porting would be done immediately, still on the ""temporary"" number after 3 weeks. Waste of time talking to managers as they never follow up. I would never recommend BT to anyone not because the actual kit is not good (it is) but the customer service is so very bad. So the response to my review from BT is to contact them via FB or Twitter, better suggestion would be to actually review the complaint I made 8 days ago and phone me as was promised umpteen times!So 5 weeks down the line and now I have no telephone service from BT and despite speaking to over a dozen BT employees, 12 different orders, 4 complaints and 13 missed scheduled calls or actions, I am not much closer to getting my original phone number ported over. Have had to go back to my last phone provider to get a working phone because BT have given me 3 phone numbers and then disconnected them, 2 of them I was not even aware of. Forgot to mention the 3+ hours on the phone with them.",Graham Kelsey,2021,8,4,1,0.122,0.068,Negative
I question BT Broadband,I pay for fibre to the premises with 100Mb supposedly guarenteed. I can try 5 or more independant speed test sites and they say I receive 15 to 30 Mb download speed. At the same time BT's Site says I get 148Mb. Regarding actual performance the BT internet continually buffers on catch up tv and generally performs worse than my previous provider when I was on 7Mb minimum guarenteed.

BT says it's Openreach responsibility and Openreach never responds. When ever I get a response it's the same people from both sides hence BT says we got nothing to do with Openreach.

Openreach make appointments and don't turn up. Get escalated to Directors Office although there appears to be lots of these and they're just as ineffective. The Heads of Customer Service at BT and Openreach clearly haven't got a clue of what's going on in their business, hence the negative reports and scores on here.

Would give zero stars if I could after…,"Would give zero stars if I could after 6 months of hell with BT. Started when my husband died and I phoned to change the account into my name. Woman from bereaved services at BT replied “I will need to talk to your husband”. I requested paperwork to apply for Basic Package (can’t be done online apparently) BT insisted after 4 months of phone calls it had been sent. It hadn’t. Probably because this would have cut my package price from over £100 per month to £10 per month. I eventually went with another phone and broadband company. When BT found out they immediately sent me basic package paperwork 6 times. Along with a letter (included in paperwork) saying I did not qualify for basic package. Not sure how they knew this. I was then sent bags to return their equipment which I did. Another 12 bags arrived over 2 months requesting their equipment. Then I had the pleasure of a demand for nearly £400 for terminating my contract early ? I phoned and pointed out I’d never signed a contract so for once this issue was easily resolved. Then more demands for money followed 2 months after I had changed provider. I was informed that I had only changed internet provider, not phone provider. Utter rubbish. Eventually I told BT that their behaviour bordered on harassment and to stop contacting me. I would rather have no internet and communicate through 2 tin cans and a piece of string than ever have anything to do with this ridiculous and unprofessional company again.

AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS,"Avoid these people at all costs if you want a simple broadband set up completed in a reasonable timescale. Not only do they not deliver on their promises to turn up and install broadband, their customer service staff, which in itself is a massive oxymoron, lie through their teeth to get rid of you. Their communication is appalling, they have no sense of service and don't even have the common decency to apologise when they screw up. Do like I should have done and avoid them at all costs unless you're prepared to wait weeks, hoping you may be able to get on line. If they promise any dates for service, don't plan anything around it as you will be disappointed. It's a shame there is no option for zero stars.UPDATE 18/8/21 - so here we are 2 weeks on and still no broadband.The engineer finally turned up to say there was a fault on the line.

Quite what he thought he was going to do I've no idea, but I am very capable of plugging in a router and typing a password myself. We are now 6 weeks in and still no broadband. I'm wondering whether this is 1921 not 2021. So once again, I am forced to take another day's unpaid leave as they can't give you an appointment that suits you - the customer - in either the evenings or the weekends.

I phoned at 8am, spoke to 4 different advisors for over an hour only to be told the fault could possibly be fixed by 06/08!

Never use BT,The worst customer experience I’ve ever had with any company. A litany of failings and downright lies. I ordered Fibre to the Premises for installation between 0800 - 1300 on a set day and took leave from work. No one turned up with no contact made. Having phoned BT to chase its status apparently the engineer went to the wrong house and installed the fibre (lucky them). Zaheer from Openreach called to state another appointment would be made for the next day 1300 - 1800 on a Saturday. So weekend plans were changed. This time I rang BT in the morning to make sure that I actually would have an engineer on site. Sam from Dundee confirmed that my installation would happen that day.Engineer arrived at 13:30 and announced on the doorstop that he was here to check the installation undertaken yesterday. Hmm no you’re not was my reply. Cue 5-10 mins while the engineer checked the job details on his laptop in the van. The engineer returned to state that there must be a mix-up and that an installation was impossible on a weekend as they didn’t hold the right equipment in their vans and that the stores were not open. So both Zaheer and Sam must be completely mistaken then. Cue another call to the wonderful BT Customer Service. This time Olivia in Belfast said that she had spoken to Openreach who had in turn spoken to said engineer - apparently he didn’t have enough cable in his van to undertake the installation. What the hell is now going on? As there is still 4 hours left in the window (to 1800) there must be a way for an engineer to source cable in time - other engineers in the local area perhaps? Anyway several calls and getting absolutely nowhere to the point that BT Customer Service just hang up when I simply to ask to speak to a manager. A day’s valuable leave wasted and a weekend ruined.

Then we found out that even though we were moving abroad and BT couldn't provide the service in our new destination they would charge us the remaining contract time. This is absolute nonsense.

BT CUSTOMER SERVICE PRAISE,I have always used BT. I just figure that if it has to come down their phoneline then probably best to use them. In the past I have never had a reason to complain or praise. All has continued as normal. I would though like to sing their praises now. I recently had an issue where a bill didn't get paid to BT due to a husband/wife breakdown in communications. This lead to BT engaging a debt solution company. On receipt of a letter from the debt solution I was at a loss to understand what it was for. It wasn't a large amount. I  have now spoken with BT via their customer service department. They really have gone the extra mile to get to the bottom of this. It transpires that they tried to contact me on numerous occasions via email. This either went into my spam or I possibly deleted the email expecting a scam. At the end of the day it was all my fault.

Shameful behaviour from BT,"I have been a BT customer for 30 years, until now, and its not by choice. I would have preferred to continue with them.Due to working from home since March 2020 I was struggling with slow broadband as myself and my wife both work from home now and both are on video calls many times a day. I contacted BT to look to leave in August last yr but they convinced me they could improve my speed to 38 mps which would be sufficient. As a result I had to take another 2 yr contract which I did.I am now looking to move house and asked about moving my BT broadband with me but found out the fastest speed they can provide is just 3mps.I asked to give notice due to the fact they can no longer keep to the contracted 38mps but they said the contract is to provide Fibre 2 broadband, which they can still do at my new house, not the speed. Therefore, even though they are unable to provide the speed I took out a new contract to receive, I still have to pay £572 to exit the contract. I have no option as I cannot do my job off 3mps and when I spoke to someone at BT she actually agreed that it is BTs fault but there is nothing she can do. They are essentially restricting me as to where I can live and work which is preposterous.

Deplorable lack of customer care,"I have been without broadband since 13th July and what a fiasco it has been trying to get the problem resolved. It started when two incompetent so called engineers couldn't run a fibre cable to my property due to a blockage. After contacting BT to inform them of the situation and obtain an assurance, verbally and in writing, I wouldn't lose connection, low and behold around an hour after the cowboy engineers left, my service ceased. So here we are, 28th July and STILL no broadband despite numerous calls, failed engineer visits, lies, broken promises and diarised calls not being made. As I write, I'm patiently waiting for a call back from yesterday to resolve the complaint. This was on the back of an hour and a half call to BT only to be hung up on. Absolute joke of an organisation given that communication is their thing but, it's one thing they fail to do.",Nigel Burrows,2021,7,28,1,0.11,0.081,Negative

I’ve never left a negative review before..,"I’ve never left a negative review before. But this company are diabolical!- took 1.47 hrs on the phone to sign up. (Had to go through details twice) - the agent entered wrong address when taking payment, which meant the bank thought it was fraud and blocked BT. I then had to use my emergency credit card. Which I will get charged for.- then a couple of days later got a text to say my BT account had been cancelled.- chased every day and was told someone would fix and update me.(from fibre team)- nobody updated me- received a refund - Delayed so chased again, explained the situation. Placed on hold then cut off.- spoke go FB chat who called me and transferred to Fibre team. My partner needed to start working from home in our new house) was told wouldn’t be ready by original date as it hadn’t been fixed. Man fixed on the phone and sent out hub box. (Partner had to book emergency holiday as the box wouldn’t be there until 2 days later) but promised would be 2 days latest- text from Royal Mail said it would arrive 3 days later) contacted BT who apologised and said it would be 3 days later.- hub ended up arriving on the 2nd day, but when we went to fit. We called to be told it should have come with wires in the box (the wires were missing) - called and were told we would need to post the box back and they would send out a replacement (meaning my partner would not be able to work for more days)- asked to speak to a supervisor was told that they would just tell me the wires needed to be sent.By far the worst service I have ever had. Our whole relocation was based on my partners job letting him work from home. So this has not made the best impression for him.

LANDLINE Repaired YESTERDAY Thanks JL,"I have altered this review from a one star to a five star review., For one reason, a BT customer care advisor helped get my landline repaired on the same day as I spoke to her,she knows who I talking about.The reasons mentioned here I informed J of. She was most helpful and considerate. I spoke to many advisors and explained my concerns,but only J helped me perfectly,she is a credit to BT. Many thanks  My landline faulted,no dialing tone unable to receive calls, I reported it online as my broadband was still working. I explained I need my landline as the mobile signal where I live is extremely poor,unable to use it indoors or receive calls on it. At home I have to go into the street to use it, As my landline is my only way of communication, and I also have medical issues,I am also waiting for some test results,I understand the medical team will telephone me on my landline number,,,so BT several times did said they would put the fault though as priority.

I challenged this over and over on a 90 minute call only to be told it was THE ONLY way I could resolve the issue of connection (even though at every step I notified BT of the situation and was assured it would be fine and not a problem) when requested escalation to speak with supervisor the poor adviser on the line was just again told to tell me the only way I was to get online was following HIM cancelling the order and restarting.... I questioned this over and over as I had been categorically told not to do this and I insisted if it was cancelled it would be BT doing this without my consent.... again reassured compensation and all notes would remain and it wouldn’t be an issue...and he would call me between 8am and 9am....already a complete lie as received a text advising a call between 8 and 10.... even though I clearly stated I was only available between 8am and 9am......but hey, my engineer Jamie was due between 8am and 1pm and arrived at 5.45pm.....absolute shambles and poor poor customer service...... don’t even have the energy to comment on the open reach engineer who visited my home and spoke over me constantly telling me that an over head line 1.5metres in front of our neighbours bedroom window was the best way for him and customer service doesn’t get taken into account as if anything goes wrong They have to pay for it.......the underground option isn’t “favoured”....... open reach blame BT, BT blame open reach and I am left with shoddy unprofessional processes..... and still no service......no information about potential work...... notes on system date 20th added following subsequent calls claiming customer didn’t respond to offer of underground fitting..... imagine it being like ordering a pizza, paying for it but also paying for a new car for the delivery driver to bring it to you and then the delivery driver dropping your food, spitting on it and blaming you...... that is my current level of service from BT.... absolutely shocking..... don’t tell me to tweet or anything, you ignored all other contacts I’ve requested so far..... let’s see what jackanory I get tomorrow!!!!",Tracy Louise,2021,7,26,1,0.078,0.05,Negative

If you want anything sorted you have to keep calling until they escalate your case to an actual technician who knows what they're doing (in fairness, once I got through to one he was pretty good. Giving me updates and providing solutions).*internet was connected over a MONTH after my due go-live date. Had to use my phone 4G while working from home for a software company. Embarrassing constantly lagging in meetings and dropping out. Not to mention having to switch mobile phone provider just so I could get unlimited data as my current one didn't offer it.*Was sent a mini-hub after weeks of calling support. Wasn't until our case was raised to an actual technician he sent out a 4G mini-hub to tide us over.*Returned mini-hub and got billed £50 for not returning it. We 100% put it in the ludicrously oversized returns bag and posted it (god job reducing plastic waste and looking out for the planet).*Slow speeds and dropouts. I've tried multiple devices (PC, MacBook) and multiple services (Adobe, Steam, etc), and none seem to reach download speeds over 6mb/s. And if I am downloading something it pretty much cripples our speeds to about 3mb/s.So now I have to spend more time and money buying a landline phone so I can do a ""quiet line test"" to see if there's a fault there.God forbid if there is a fault because I'll have to phone customer service.I can count on one hand the number of times I've left reviews for services because they've been so utterly rubbish.Congratulations BT for making the list",Adam.,2021,7,25,1,0.079,0.082,Positive

For the supposed best internet on the market, I expect far better. Giving free data on the mobile associated with the account when it *really* craps out is not enough to make up for this poor service.And BT, before you leave a comment saying 'please get in touch and we can help you improve your speed' - don't patronise us.

First of l my please accept my apologies for emailing when you're staff can't do there jobs correct and now given on being in hold Nd trying to sort this out . Time line leading up to making this formal complaint today with CEO for both EE and BT . Yesterday being 23 July 21 phoned up EE sales and got to speak with someone in Wales contact centre I explored my offers and what's sort of plans I would be looking etc . I had to provide card information and direct debit information which is pretty much standard . The account was accepted with an upfront of £100.00 refund in 6 months approximately I believe. Then went on delivery which I was told £9.98 for Saturday I object to paying this amount because of my commitment Monday to Friday. One of the opportunity was to go in to store this has caused problems which I moved on to in this complex email later on . After leaving the call with sales I phoned customer service for EE an spoken with someone who I didn't provide me is name he also didn't record my account because I didn't give or he asked for information for the account.Some of agents comments were not acceptable too . He also said about the 6.98 charge for Monday to Friday by dpd which the sales agent didn't talk about at all . I then phoned back again again and asked to raise a formal complaint I got in touch with Ireland's call centre she advised me approximately 2 hours this never happened at all . This morning I phoned my local EE store couldn't get in touch at all this was also to find what's information I need also if phones available. I couldn't reach the store . When I went in to the store today at Stockport waste of my time saying I need photos I'd of which the ones they require I don't have at all . EE should of advice me correct and I wouldn't of wasted my time at all . This evening I phoned up about this spoken to Kelly I believe in Ireland she went to review phone call never came back so I ended the call.This my reason for emailing you both . Please can you acknowledge this formal email and get someone to reach out to me .I do look forward to hearing from someone soon .Also thanks for giving me the great experience I an sure you're happy with what they given me .,Ant.

Now they are saying it will be next week before they can even send another engineer from open reach. We were meant to have confirmation of this but it hasn't arrived. I suspect that the engineer will again not come and not fix it and we will be left having to pay for an EE box to use forever more because BT cant fix a service we pay for.

illegal changing of how i pay my bill,"just opened my phone bill to find it says this is my first bill since changing the way i pay (do not know what this is about) phone up, first the gent says do not know how this has happened then kept going away to check things out a few times them said i must have pressed the wrong button when paying my last bill on the phone, and my credit card is now on repeat every 3 months to pay my bill, I DO NOT HAVE A CREDIT CARD, then give me the last 4 numbers of the card witch is a debit card, the gent escalated this as i do not want this and go back to paying over the phone as i have done for many years, but told this could not be done.i then went on to paying my bill and told a direct debit would take the money out tomorrow.does anybody know what s going on, i think it is about time i leave B T after over 50 years i got a reply from  B T  to say send your message on twitter or facebook and it will be actioned if you mention Trustpilot, this was from John.I  the meantime, i got a E.Mail from B. T to say my case had been closed this was just over a hour after i called them to complain with nobody from  B T  calling me.So i called again and got through to the Dundee office and spoke to a gent, he put me through to a person called Daniel, who was very rude and arrogant, he said all this was my fault by pressing the wrong button on the phone when i told him i did not do this he was calling me a liar and he could do nothing to help me and i should go to my bank and sort it out, as i do not have a local bank branch beside me is was impossible, this person is a disgrace to any company, when i asked about my case being closed he said yes it was, but i was down for a call today (thursday) still waiting the next day for a call.DISGUSTING COMPANY",Mrs Mitcheson,2021,7,22,1,0.117,0.015,Negative
BT is a completely different company these days,"I've been a loyal customer for many years. Last year after moving home I had to migrate to Zen Internet (which I recommend highly) because BT had not been able to install the connection in a reasonable time to my new property. This year I was talked into moving my 4 BT Mobile numbers to EE and on the same call I was promised that if I cancel with Zen and come back to BT I will be able to enjoy G.Fast speeds up to 300Mbps which would be a marked improvement over 70Mbps I was provided at that time. I placed 3 orders since May, each was cancelled due to technical reasons, wrong address, out of sync data- pick your favourite. My last installation date was 19th of July, that got cancelled too on 16th. Unfortunately BT forgot to let Zen know that the service transfer won't be happening and guess what, Zen disconnected me this Monday. So due to negligence and incompetence of BT I'm now left without home broadband!!! My wife and kids want to kill me every day. I spent hours on the phone talking to customer service, to no avail. Each time.I.call I have to explain my complex case case again, representatives don't bother to leave notes or records of my previous conversations in their CRM system. In parallel it took me 4 attempts to establish with Openreach that my phone line doesn't support G.fast speeds and I'm limited to FTTC service. A new order was placed with installation date for 30th but I was told that this one will likely to be cancelled as well because it was for a G.Fast product Fibre 250 which can't be provisioned at my address!! How is it possible that a BT sales team was able to create an order for a service that can't be delivered? So now I have to wait until another installation date passes (on 30th) and maybe the glitch in the system can be fixed so I can place an order for standard Fibre 2. It's been an absolutely shambolic, misleading and dishonest customer service. This company is doing everything to alienate and lose its customers.",Mr   Mikolaj Majewski,2021,7,22,1,0.093,0.048,Negative

They used to be a good company that cared about it’s customers, but sadly not anymore. I took out a contact with them 11 years ago when we moved house. I took out their Business Featureline and one plan plus all inclusive call package and put my other phone line on call forwarding and unlimited broadband package. The price was costly but it was good and all worked nicely for my business until this January 2021 when I noticed that they had changed the layout of my  phone bill. Since then they have been charging me usage changes which are spiralling out of control. When you call to get it sorted they just want to sell me a useless cloud phone which wouldn’t work in the village where I live. They  keep telling me that there’s nothing they can do .

BT customer service - a dystopian nightmare,"After I cancelled my BT service when I moved house, I received an email asking me to return my BT box in the bag provided. I never received a bag (presumably they sent it to my old address). And so began a three-month dystopian nightmare.I called three or four times to ask them to send the bag, was promised each time that they would, but they never arrived. Next, I was told I could take the box to any EE store. After traipsing all around London to EE stores to try and hand my box in, it turns out they're not taking them due to Covid and I had been given duff info by BT and wasted my time and effort.Then I started getting the emails demanding I pay £115 for the box and the threat of debt collection agencies. After several more calls, a woman I spoke to said she would mark the box as returned, I would get an email confirming this within 24 hours and that would be the end of the matter.Guess what? I never got that email, just another threatening email demanding £115. I called again and was told it was impossible to mark the box as returned without returning it so the previous woman was either lying or just incompetent.I asked if they could send a courier to collect it and was told this was absolutely impossible. Raised a complaint and when the person rang me about my complaint, guess what - there is a specific ParcelForce service BT use for just this kind of scenario.So why did someone not tell me that in the first place?? All in all, over three months I think I must have had to call BT about 12 times to try and return this box, each time having to go over the whole story again.The worst thing was, no-one I spoke to showed the slightest bit of sympathy for the inconvenience I had been caused, and didn't even seem surprised by my story, like it was a totally normal thing.My overall impression is that BT is a massive, faceless corporation where the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, there's no consistency at all in what you're told by their staff and basically they couldn't give two hoots about their customers.",Tim,2021,7,21,1,0.121,0.057,Negative

Cancelled the service and yet billed…for the second time,"After years of poor service and broadband speed always falling below the minimum contracted terms, I managed to cancel my account. They cancelled the account and told me my final bill would arrive within 7 days but this did not happen. Instead, the system continues to bill me on a monthly basis and they say they cannot fix this. This happened to me in the past when I cancelled my previous account and it took months of complaints and, eventually, the action of my MP to get it resolved. BT does not complete the cancellation process and continues to bill customers for closed accounts. Then, they start sending debt collectors for money they do not owe and ruin people’s lives. I am shocked this company is allowed to trade as it looks like some sort of organised scam. I am deeply distressed thinking about the coming months and how long it will take to get this resolved, especially considering the agent is refusing to escalate my complaint to the next stage. To BT: Before you ask, I don’t have Twitter or FB and I have already contacted you by phone and mail so, if you want to look into this, that’s the only way I can contact you.",Sergio,2021,7,21,1,0.15,0.058,Negative
"If I could rate them 0 stars, I would","If I could rate them 0 stars,  I would. As a loyal customer for decades (and 11 years at this address), stupidly now paying £115 pm for broadband and TV, I called last week to ask to take advantage of the new BT Home Essentials service for those on low incomes. This would give me broadband and very basic TV for £27 per month. All of the telecoms companies have committed to providing social tariff rates for people like me who are in receipt of means tested benefits. BT's version of this is *supposed* to be BT Home Essentials,  but they won't tell you about this product, even if you ask. They are more likely to sell you a more EXPENSIVE broadband package than you're already on, which was what happened to me on my first call to them last week to discuss how I could access cheaper broadband.  Even if you tell BT EXACTLY what you want, ie ""I want BT Home Essentials"", they will say they'll put you on that plan but that too will be a lie. Because they won't do what they say, they'll just fob you off with promises and platitudes. When you call again the following week, to chase up your new service, they will tell you that you are not actually in receipt of Income Support (one of their eligibility criteria) even though you are...even though it is your husband's name that receives it through the National Insurance number, and YOU, as his wife, are deemed to be on Income Support for ALL other legal purposes including claiming Housing Benefit or free school meals for your son!!!...they will bizarrely suggest that YOU should instruct the DWP to change THEIR systems...it would be funny if it wasn't so distressing. I'm disabled with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, in a wheelchair and I need cheap broadband. I suffer with depression, and extreme anxiety for which I have ongoing counselling. These phone calls to BT have tested my mental resilience to its extreme. I have cried at times which is so embarrassing to admit. My husband is my carer, hence Income Support for Carers (a very specific type of benefit that blows up BTs algorithm) and my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last February.  If we, on our low income and in our vulnerable position, don't qualify for the social tariff then who does??? The attitude of blunt advisers who transferred me through to dead ends, or to others who couldn't help, was particularly challenging as I LOVE repeating myself over...and over...and over...knowing they're never listening to me and that they do not give a damn and that nothing will change because BT simply don't care about providing even a basic level of decent customer service. Special mention must go to Joseph, in the ""loyalty team"", who offered broadband and basic TV at 39.99 per month. But when I asked if I could take some time to think about it, as I  don't want a full 24month contract because - to be blunt - I don't know if my husband will die in the next 24 months, Joseph warned me that I would need to decide there and then. He said, ""I can't promise that this offer will be available beyond today"". Talk about duress and bad sales practice. I have had enough of them. I feel discriminated against as a vulnerable disabled customer about whom they don't just not care. They pay lip service (in meaningless policy statements) to their supposedly accessible services! I have now raised this matter with OFCOM. I will raise it with relevant Members of Parliament and the media (where necessary) in order to raise awareness of how inaccessible & misrepresented BT's supposedly beneficial social tariff truly is. As a former lawyer myself, if I had ever treated any of my clients in such an obstructive and disdainful manner, I would have rightly expected to go out of business.  It's a shame that BT are too big to fail; they certainly don't deserve to succeed.

Having dealt with BT for many years I…,"Having dealt with BT for many years I think I’m well placed to review what sort of company they’ve become. They used to be outstanding and it always seemed refreshing to deal with them compared to other companies. They are now an outright shambles putting it mildly without the use of expletives. Back in may I decided to renew my BB package and upgrade to fibre initially and stupidly through their chat facility from the app. All good with a date and time 8-1 for them installing fibre. Day came and no sign of them by 1pm. So I tried calling 3 times (10, 10, 17 minutes before being cut off) Get to speak to an advisor eventually to be told order was cancelled as I didn’t sign permission for work. NOBODY EVER MENTIONED IT BEFORE.So I had it emailed and I filled it in and sent it back and was told a new order was going to be placed. Up to now I’ve had 3 orders cancelled and just found out they’ve got to place an new order tomorrow. On top of all this I’ve been chased to send back my old equipment when how can I send it back when I haven’t had the new equipment installed.If anyone is thinking of joining BT, unless you’ve got a deathwish steer well clear and search for another company that has considerably better reviews if there are any.

Had to order before being told when equipment would be delivered, was told could not change this date on their system,   so had to cancel that order and start again with broadband and digital voice order so I could get a date convenient to me to receive the equipment. Ended up having a digital voice No. that only half worked? only rang for 5 seconds before cutting out, was not fully “registered”? on my account so could not get; answer phone ,call protect or alter ring-time ect. Took days on the phone-being passed from one department to the next and 2 may be 3 official fault reports filed and many wasted minuted retesting the equipment my end. Turned out I should not have been given that No. So after nearly three month passing was given a new Home Telephone No after I had informed family and friend and change all my life admin to my first Number. Not only that they then charged me an xtra £7 plus for my new voice service on top of my agreed original contact so being charged for the extra second line. Have tried to get this off my bill been told it will go to yet another department within accounts to get sorted,this was on 4th July now 15 days on the charge is still on my account and next payment due soon.

Don't Even Think of Using This Abysmal Company!,"First of all, let me make it clear that if I could have left a zero star review I would have done!  Here is my story:Having had a slow but generally reliable broadband service from BT for the last 4 years, we suddenly started to find our internet kept dropping out.  We contacted BT and reported the problems, and eventually after 3 months of intermittent broadband, numerous visits from engineers, and numerous phone calls, we were told by one of the engineers that BT could no longer provide us with broadband, as basically they'd put too many people on our supply line, and as we are right at the end of the longest line in our county (11km) everyone else got priority over us!!  As they could not put us on another line, as suggested by the engineer, we decided to get our internet elsewhere via 4G, and just keep a basic landline with BT as we're very rural, and can't rely on a mobile signal or 4G in case of emergency.  We informed them that we wanted to cancel the broadband, but keep our landline, but each time they tried to do this, we received an email telling us that we would also be having our landline cut off!  I even had an argument with a member of staff that I was speaking to on the phone at the time, when I told him that I'd just received an email telling me that my broadband AND phone line were to be cut off, when he'd just confirmed that ONLY my broadband was to go.  I even read it out to him, but he said on his screen it clearly said that I was only going to lose my broadband.  I asked him who I could speak to to get it sorted out, and he said he 'didn't know!'  I was sick to the back teeth of BT by this point, and had even tried emailing their CEO TWICE with no response, so decided to try contacting them via Resolver.  Finally, the next day I received a call from someone high up, who sorted everything out .......... or so we thought!!  This was about a month ago, then today, I opened an email from BT, telling me that as I was now having my broadband back, I would no longer be receiving the discount for my line rental!!!  Not only that, but we also discovered that our landline has been cut off this morning!!  I have spoken to someone at BT who confirmed that the landline has been cut off, and it's not just a fault, and she is now looking into it!!  Whether or not I'll get a call back remains to be seen.Meanwhile, I am left wondering why a company as big as BT can't seem to get even the simplest task right, and would recommend anyone even thinking of using them to go elsewhere, or risk months and months of frustration, and wasted time on phone calls to people who just can't seem to do their job properly anymore.",Judi Bowen,2021,7,17,1,0.09,0.032,Negative

I'm not currently on my third adviser on chat, just to find out where it is.3.  As I was under the impression that I only had business accounts, I bought my number across from Vodafone.  In trying to bring this from personal to business, I absolutely give up.  I spoke to AT LEAST 12 people.  I need my number brings across from personal to business PAC code from personal BTC742658.4.  Also one I have up on.  I need access to BT WiFi Hotspots.  I have a username and password.  I log into the app, fine.  I try and log into WiFi, it keeps saying its incorrect login details.  I reset my password.  Same thing.  Log into app, fine.  No access still to hotspots.5.  Chats and calls and absolutely ridiculous.  As we speak, I'm onto advisor three, everyone keeps telling me its not their department.  This goes for every issue I've experienced.  I've made contact AT LEAST two dozen times in ten days.  Absolutely nothing has been resolved.6.Narender Singh is refusing to give me the complaints email for BT, insisting that the BT support email is where I need to raise a concern.This is unbelievably poor service, form the countries oldest telephony provider.  I then had three phone calls from a lady called Cathy.  As BT still couldn't work out what was happening, I decided to try and make a call myself.  154 being the number for BT business, from a BT handset.  I made 5 calls through different options, none of which were directed to BT business.  When I finally did get through to the right department, I was told my replacent router wasn't, and isn't in stock.  So, it couldn't have been ordered.  Cathy then called me back to say that my order is with the warehouse.  When I challenged her, asking when the delivery date is, to which she informed me she didn't know.  I told her, that's because I've just called and found out that it isn't even on stock.  I added that no one even called, or emailed to tell me.  It had just been left.It's just unbelievable.  Just really big problems with BT.  Way too compartmentalised.  Their internal  Telephony and communication, needs rebuilding from the bottom up.  Ironic for a company that's key services are telephony and communication.UPDATE ANOTHER WEEK ONRight,I'm not playing this game anymore.  I've been more than patient.  Even when I've out my patience, nothing is resolved.  This comedy of errors is ever going.  To add, BT tried to take £50 from my account yesterday, of which I will get charges, for the personal account that should have been closed before my business order was even processed. So...1 - Get rid of the bills for my personal account. 2 - Please cancel the mobile Internet line, and send me a returns bag for the Outdoor router, as I have now placed an order elsewhere.  But, make sure you do not cancel the line attached to my mobile phone, the one of which my number was ported across (07889 630 138).3 - Please get my hotspot sorted by close of play Monday 19th July.  Failure to do so, will result in me cancelling my phone as well.4 - My bill payment cycle should well start once I have full working services.  So, please ensure I am not charged up till that point, and we start will full data from then.  As you have not even yet offered compensation, I believe that to be be fair.Lance",Lance Hunt,2021,7,16,1,0.065,0.048,Negative
Bt cannot keep their promises,"I live in a Virgin Media monopoly area, never had trouble with them. A fine day in April, Openreach were laying fibre in front of my property and the speeds got me excited, kept checking FTTP availability until June, to realise that my neighbours have FTTP available and not mine.Called BT to rectify it, took Openreach a week to rectify. Placed an order on the phone (7th June) to be installed in 3 weeks. I gave my one month notice to Virgin Media in anticipation of BT keeping their promise. External work was scheduled - nobody turned up, Internal work was scheduled - nobody turned up. After a call, I was told the installation will be end of July. Those dates were not feasible and I cancelled the order.External work was completed the next morning after I cancelled my order, I did not give up the FTTP dream and placed a new order which was to be activated on 09th July (as the external work was already completed). I have requested Virgin Media to extend the service  until 10th July. On the internal installation Engineer visited promptly, installed, but could not connect / activate as the routing was incorrect and this could be a week to rectify. I called BT to understand the next steps, I was promised that the service will be activated on 12th July, which did not happen, I rang them on the 12th, they will get to know next steps on 16th, I called them on the 16th, I am told I will get to know on the 19th.  I do not have broadband since 6 days, me and my wife Working from home using mobile internet (tethering). BT have not been able to provide a confirmed date of install or an alternative. They kept using the Openreach card each time I ask them to commit to a date.I now wish, I did not see Openreach laying fibre. Really ! They do not have any respect for customers, they don't mind them leaving. When I cancelled the first time, they were not interested, they did not even ask me why and what would make me stop. Today, When I mentioned I might stick to my current provider, they were swift to respond to my cancellation comment.If my line gets installed, I worry about the service and how long would they take to fix it. This is poor from a Telecom giant. BT, As a domestic client I might not matter, but the promises you make should mean something and I suggest you fix Openreach.-----------------------------------------------17th JulyFollowing my above review, John from BT responded to message @bt_uk on twitter for an update.Unfortunately, I had the same response as his colleagues which added to my woes.What puzzles me, they aren't even proposing an alternative solution, I know they can send a 5G dongle or something similar to alleviate the situation. So, lack of empathy, problem solving must be prevalent at all levels..===================BT have sent me a 4g hub (fancy as it sounds), speeds were less than 4mb / 1mb, returned it promptly.I was called by BT, told me it might take a further 12 weeks to fix the problem and activate.They have been extremely persistent in breaking my resolve.I have now cancelled my contract with them and  signed up for Virgin Media, I was up and running in 2 days.Proceed with caution.. You are not important to BT and that's how I was made to feel.. Not going back to them anytime soon.. Nor would I recommend them for anything, even if it's free.",VC,2021,7,16,1,0.056,0.073,Positive

Wow!,"Wow, BT have really got their act together!The last time I was with BT, nearly 10 years ago. I used to find the customer care abysmal to the point where I'd just put up with issues until my contract expired.I signed up back in June 2021 and was up and running 3 days later than my 'go live' date (which I was fairly compensated for). I'm glad I went with their Hybrid package, so I wasn't without internet until the issue was cleared. However, since that small hiccup I have found talking to BT so much better. They are now UK based (UK @ NI) and it's nice that my issues are understood and not fobbed off to other departments. The equipment is reliable and the Wi-Fi signal is amazing to the point it reaches the end of my garden.Well done BT, please don't cock it up in future and thank god you stopped using overseas call centres!!",Craig,2021,7,16,5,0.011,0.185,Positive
Absolutely atrocious service,"Absolutely atrocious service. Our internet has been offline for about a month. On the best of days we get a download speed of 1MB/s and upload speed of 0.3MB/s. We were promised at least 1.5MB/s. We are paying a ridiculous amount for our broadband. It’s ridiculous how we can be charged the same amount as someone who gets fibre optic with a broadband speed &gt; 30 MB/s, so x30 more than what we get.Openreach have been attempting to fix our internet for about 3 weeks, but it is still not working. Our poles have not had any service/maintenance since 2001 according to one of their engineers.They have offered compensation of £8 per day until our internet is back up and running. This might cover the cost of the monthly broadband fee… but what about all other services we pay for that require WiFi, such as Netflix, Amazon prime, Alexa, etc?I believe that the government were targeting for the whole of the UK to get a minimum broadband speed of 10MB/s to all homes by 2020. Clearly they have failed to keep to this promise. To make things worse, there doesn’t seem to be any urgency or reassurance that they are actually trying to achieve that target anytime soon. They dismiss any possibility of fibre optic to our area.It’s such a shame that there are no other providers that we can turn to, otherwise we would have years ago. If you are thinking of using BT as your main provider, I urge you to do some research and check other providers first - I believe Virgin have their own boxes therefore they can offer a different internet line to your home.",Thomas Beesley,2021,7,15,1,0.078,0.057,Negative
I am absolutely appalled by this…,I am absolutely appalled by this service. I have now been without internet for 2 weeks. Working from home for the NHS and a son remote learning due to school being closed. It’s just unacceptable. I switched from sky to BT and was supposed to have it installed on 2nd July. They took the line over but didn’t shoe up to install it. Sky would have continued to provide my service only for this. They gave me compensation that I didn’t ask for but that’s not the point I NEED internet. Having to drive sons 12 miles away to play on Xbox’s. I had another appointment today but again no show. I have phoned and was told I get £25 for a missed appointment but then had to check this because I’ve had too much!!?? I did get it but was told there will be no more. I told him I’ve never asked for compensation all I want is the service you are supposed to be providing me. No money can replace internet in my house! No message to say no-one was coming and still don’t when or if they ever will. Worst thing I have done is to switch to BT. Internet is vital in this world especially now. Why sell you something that can’t be committed to. Just be honest in the first place and say it will take months. I bought the package on 16th June.

First call of approx one hour running through new address all seemed fine until we moved and nothing working or received as promised.  Rang again for another 40 min + call to discover that the BT geniuses had set the transfer of our landline and wifi to the house next door to where we used to live.  So went through everything again and they promised to send out a mini hub to see us through to when we got reconnected.  A few days later still nothing so rang again (another 45 min + call) and turns out they hadn't input the new address correctly....AGAIN.  The lady I ended up speaking to 3rd time around was great and we did then receive the mini hub.  However the download speeds on the mini hub are completely unacceptable (2.8 Mbps!) and have made it completely impossible to work from home effectively.  The whole experience is just completely unacceptable and a complete shambles.  Supposedly being reconnected in a few more days but I'll believe it when it happens!

"Constant cancellations, poor service and no installation","On the 12th June I contacted BT and arranged to have my broadband and telephone line transferred to them. Arrangements were made for Openreach to come and set up the broadband on the 24th June. I had to reschedule the date so I phoned a few days later to rearranged for the 3 July. However, Openreach contacted me on the 17th June by text to advise they would be visiting on the 24th June. I contacted BT on the same day and was told that the visit on the 3rd July had not been processed but they could reschedule for the 5th July. The engineer phoned me on the 24th June to confirm a time for his visit despite me contacting BT to change the date and time. On the 25th June BT contacted me to say the 3rd July is a Saturday which is a non-appointment day so an appointment with Openreach could not be scheduled. However another appointment was booked for the 27th June. I received another text message to say the 3rd and 5th July is not available so they had booked an appointment for the 2nd July. On the 27th June I received a text message to advise me that my order had been cancelled. I phoned BT and was on my phone for over an hour trying to rectify their multiple mistakes. No one at BT gave an explanation of why my order had been cancelled and I was told I had to reorder. On Friday 2nd July, I received a text message to say BT needed to book an engineer appointment to get me connected and that I needed to make contact to arrange this. I contacted BT and again booked this appointment. On the 5th July I received another email to say my order had been cancelled. Again I phoned BT and asked to speak with a manager on several occasions and this was refused. I was told my order had been cancelled and they did not know why but someone would phone me on the 6th July between 8-10am to resolve the matter. I did not receive a call from BT on the 6th July but phoned BT and was told I needed to reorder and was informed that an engineer would visit on the 13th July. On the 7th July I phoned BT again and was told that the date the engineer would visit was the 27th July not the 13th July and again I was not told why. I was given another date of the 20th July. On the 9th July I received a phone call from BT informing me that yet again my order had been cancelled, and again they were unable to explain why and said I needed to be put on hold where another team would support me with submitting another order. I have been in contact with BT on almost a daily basis for the past 3 weeks and have been on the phone for over an hour on each call. The service received has been extremely poor. I have been refused the opportunity to speak with a manager and I have not been given any explanations as to why there has been continuous cancellations and failures from BT.

Diabolical Company!,"I left BT when I moved in February, the only reason we left was because they were unable to provide a decent internet speed to our new address. We returned our equipment when we moved and despite receiving an email and text on 7th April confirming that they'd received it, they continued to regularly chase me to return it and soon said that I owed them over £200 for the equipment that I hadn't supposedly returned. I've spoken to them on live chat various times and also on the phone on 19th April, 8th May, 22nd May and 19th June. Each time the person that I have spoken to has assured me that I have no balance outstanding on my account, the equipment has been received and I'll receive no further contact asking for the equipment. The last time I spoke to them I was particularly annoyed as I was being threatened with debt collectors. After speaking to them on 19th June I'd hoped that would be the last of it. Today I have received a letter from their debt collector. To say I'm angry is an understatement. I cannot believe the absolute incompetence from one of the largest internet and phone providers in this country.

Told four different stories by different people at BT and nobody seems to understand the impact of 20 days out on two people who work from home and are totally dependent on internet access.

British Business At It's Worst,"Decided to take the plunge and go over to fibre as our estate has been upgraded recently. What a bad decision that was.First engineer from Openreach turns up the day after I signed up online. He was looking at the external infrastructure. I approached him to see if it was anything to do with me. He confirmed it was but couldn't do any preliminary work as I would lose all my services and he could not climb up to the house due to H&S reasons. Next day another engineer turns up to see why the first engineer had not done any work. In come the phone calls, the text messages and emails reminding me to stay in for a 1pm to 6pm visit to have all the installation. I stayed in all day just in case they arrived early.17.45hrs nothing had happened so I called BT to see what was happening. They confirmed that the job was still showing that the installation was still on but would contact Openreach to track down the engineer. After 21mins left on the line waiting I was cut off. I called back only to be placed in a queue. I was on the phone for 30secs short of half an hour. Turns out that no one was going to turn up but BT were not informed in time for them to let me know and give out another appointment. I've lost a days work/ pay (self employed) but that's OK because I get £25 compensation, that will just about cover it....not.Then I tell them that I wanted to cancel the contract.

Now that is almost double what I was supposed to pay a month. When I called they apologised and told me the situation was rectified. I would not have to pay anything until July and the payment will be £25.99. Well, July is here and £47 was removed from my account.  I called up only to come across the most rudest person I have ever spoken to. He was so disrespectful and did nothing to help me, only offered 63p that was credit in my account back.

"Kept cancelling my orders, 4 times now!","Ordered fibre broadband 4 times now with BT in the last  two weeks. Each order got cancelled. The first order got cancelled without notifying me - I only realised when the hub didn't arrive the day before the broadband was to be activated. Called BT and they said the order was cancelled by BT Wholesale because there was a line in the property (although there was no line in the property) which they couldn't take  over. After much back-and-forth with the customer support team, they convinced me to place another order which will require them not to try taking over the existing line in the property. I placed the 2nd order - got cancelled too. This time they said it was due to no free fibre port in a DSLAM cabinet close to the property. Once again, the customer support convinced me to place a new order because they've sorted out the problem. I did the 3rd time, cancelled; did the 4th time after another assurance, still got cancelled. Totally appalling service, inconsistent answers, and incompetency in investigating the root cause of the issue. No one has even called me back to say they're looking into getting to the root cause.

Making a house move more stressful than it should be,"Hideous experience so far with BT who unfortunately are sole provider of full fibre (the only option) at our next house.

Hours spent on the phone to advisers who make assurances that aren't then met. Not permitted by BT to take over the existing copper wire account at the new house as a temporary/bridging measure before full fibre installed.

In arrears after 1 month?,"On Fibre 100 (unlimited package) Good, fast internet; no complaint there.Signed up with 3 month promotion in November 2020, yet the December bill already showed that we owed 69 pounds. Direct debit was setup via their website but BT were not taking enough money to cover the cost of the package.Now it's been 7 months and the online platform said they'd double my DD amount, I rang them and was told I have an outstanding balance of 136 pounds because of ""usage"" but I'm on an unlimited package. They said the DD is setup wrong. They werenot able to explain how they'd arrived at 136 pounds, and were only focussed on settling the balance today, and adjusting my direct debit going forward. I mentioned not being happy and wanting to leave BT if they couldn't guarantee this would not happen again, but they only reminded me of the early cancellation fee.After hanging up, I broke down all the payments I made vs what the package cost and the numbers do not add up at all. It looks like I've overpaid by 89 (2.5 months?) because the 130 wasn't accurate. But it also looks like the next direct debit will be in September, so they'll skip Jul & Aug (2 months?).

Installation an absolute shambles,"Absolute shambles trying to get a new fibre line installed with BT. I booked my installation weeks in advance to coincide with the end of my existing provider. I followed the pre-installation checklists they sent to the letter. My engineer arrives an hour early for the Friday afternoon slot -- brilliant, I think -- and then the problems begin. Apparently as I own a leasehold first-floor flat he needs some permission from his manager to drill a hole or something. I leave him to it -- he says he's calling his manager. Then that his manager is calling their manager. Then he says that he's waiting for his manager to get back to him, he'll pop off to do another nearby job and return after that. He'll call me when he's on his way round in case I need to take the dog out. Then, nothing. I wait in all afternoon, then I try calling his mobile several times between 5 and 6pm -- no answer. At this point I'm both furious and in despair as my current connection gets cut off at midnight, and I have an online work conference to attend all weekend and am due to be working from home (online) as of Monday. I called BT customer service and they said they can't do anything until after 6pm. I called after 6pm and after going through security got cut off. No-one called me back. I called again and waited on hold for ages but had to leave for a prior appointment before I could get through.On Saturday morning, I called customer service again, to be told that I could rebook for two weeks' time. I said that wasn't a viable option for me -- I cannot be without internet for two weeks as that means I cannot work. Apparently there's nothing they can do, despite, I understand, Openreach being a subsidiary of BT and my having been stood up by the engineer. It turns out they needed 'permission' from the ground floor flat, and as the occupants happened to not be in when the engineer knocked on their door at midday on Friday, that was that. I should talk to them to get permission. I explained I'd already done that earlier in the week -- the engineer had never asked me about this nor communicated any of this to me. I asked to speak to the person's manager in a futile attempt to get internet installed without having to wait two weeks. Manager not in until Tuesday -- they will call me then. Ridiculous. I left it that I was cancelling my order.Since then, I've had once missed call from a London number on Tuesday (customer services manager?), and have received a confirmation of my new installation date in two weeks' time along with a permission form from Openreach that I'd have to print out and get the GFF to sign. I don't have a printer, and I'd cancelled my order.In order to be able to do my job, I reactivated my previous provider's line and am now tied into an 18-month contract with them.",Nicole E,2021,6,24,1,0.055,0.011,Negative

They handled the complaints badly then.  After having the service for a few months this did manage to pass and the internet did finally have a stable connection.I spoke to them to renew (on behalf of my fiancee) I asked specifically if there was be costs with moving to another address  as my fiancee had planned to move in about 6 months. I was told there would not be. Now my fiancee is moving she has been advised there are either going to be additional costs or the contract will have to be renewed for an additional 2 years. My fiancee would not of taken out the contract if this was the case. I handled the complaints procedure on her behalf as she is a nurse and extremely overworked due to the pandemic.  The lady that contacted me on behalf of BT, basically told me that as my fiancee had extended the contract there is nothing she can do. When I got irritated by this and tried to escalate the matter higher as i was not happy the lady refused to let me answer a question, then she said she would be ending the call with me. I have opened a new complaint with how the lady handled the matter but so far have not be contacted again. Main points: Do not trust what BT's sale team tell you when you're extending your contract. BT's complaints team will not try and assist you they will simple talk over you and make excuses to cancel the call with you (for example i was told she was ending the call because i swore at her even though i said the word she considered a swear word 5 minuets before she ended the call,  and  I used the word in the context of describing two options stating ""the two options they had given were s***"". To clarify not at her, but as a description of both options costing over £140.) They will allow people to be added to your account to speak on behalf of the account holder, but when you ask tough questions they will hide behind the fact they can only talk to the account holder about ""those issues"". Avoid BT - (I have previously been with Virgin media who never had these issues, it is just a shame they are not available everywhere. )Updated: To respond to comment.

Excellent service after the shambles of Now TV and Talktalk,"Placed an order for a new phone and internet service through Now TV who had supplied her previous address, for my 90 year old mother-in-law moving into independent supported accommodation, and for whom a landline telephone is her main means of contact with friends and family, not having a mobile phone or a mobile signal in her home. Only when the Openreach engineer turned up 2 weeks later was it discovered that Now TV only offers fibre to cabinet not fibre to premises packages, and as the property has had fibre to premises since built 2 years ago they understandably aren't going to reverse the advance of technology to suit Now TV.  Now TV should have known what was available at the address and ensured it didn't appear on comparison sites for the address or take the order.Back to square one, no apology or offer of compensation, but as important the utterly useless Ofcom doesn't monitor cancellations and has no means of knowing just how often this sort of thing happens.So we place an order with Talktalk and low and behold on the day the service is due to go live, another 2 weeks later, the Openreach engineer comes but says he has an order for internet but no phone line.  We contact Talktalk and get told that they do not offer landline over the internet as a product with fibre to premises so yet again the order is cancelled, there is no offer of compensation, and again the utterly useless Ofcom won't know about it because they don't monitor cancellations.I did cringe placing an order with Talktalk but they appeared to be offering the quickest supply of a line, we had recently been paid a total of £725 compensation by Talktalk for the abysmal total lack of service taking 111 days to install a second line to our home, and we had to refer it to the mediation service CISAS to get it.So we call BT who arrange remotely for the line to go  live the next working day.  Unfortunately they, like Now TV and Talktalk hadn't mentioned that my mother-in-law's old large button plug in phone could be plugged in but wouldn't work with a phone line over the internet, but they arranged an Openreach engineer to visit and then provided a suitable phone free of charge and are giving the first two months use of the service rent free by way of saying sorry for the inconvenience.  Well done BT for providing such a prompt service and for recovering the situation after the wrong phone hiccup.  And the utterly useless Ofcom won't know about that either.",Jeremy,2021,6,18,5,0.09,0.053,Negative

This has triggered them to somehow start taking payments out of my bank account again (I have since complained and they have stopped this and begun a refund process).Every time I ring through they're always really polite and confident in their resolutions, but when it comes down to actually getting actions done I have to chase and complain to get it sorted myself.Happy I've now switched to a much easier (and working) company.",Mr R,2021,6,17,2,0.069,0.053,Negative

BT. They have no shame!,"BT reuse to let me leave without paying the rest of my contract fees despite not giving me the service I signed up for. To leave I must pay £197. I have a ADSL Internet connection which, despite ridiculously slow upload and download speeds which I tolerate, continually loses connection and displays the dreaded ‘yellow light’ on my router signalling a loss of service, REPEATEDLY, 10-20 times a day!! BT offered many ‘workaround’ fixes, free phone data, new routers (x3), engineer visits etc. After my need for a better connection became essential due to large file upload/download for work, up to 6GB+, I decided to leave BT and join Virgin Media which was cheaper and has impressively fast fibre broadband in my area. BT then claim, that my loss of Internet connection isn’t technically a ‘drop’ in service and happens simply because the accompanying landline has a fault on it!! I explained, it doesn’t matter what or where the source or location of the problem is, all that matters is I’m not receiving the service I should be. To which they respond with their final word on the matter (after long debates and endless transferring from department to department) that my Internet has only ever ‘dropped’ connection twice during the last year and has always been ‘provided’ otherwise and it’s the problem with my landline that causes the problem with the Internet connection at my end, and therefor, because they’ve continued to provide broadband at the speed contractually agreed upon from their end, I am not free to leave without paying the rest of my contract!! Can you believe it!! I said it doesn’t matter what you provide at your end, what matters is what I receive at my end, AND I RECEIVE REPEATED DROPS IN SERVICE!!!

This isn't directly targeted towards BT, but many companies will sell their services using Mbps as opposed to the ACTUAL download/upload speeds, and for people who are not tech-savvy, will feel disorientated by the unnecessary conversions.Beyond that, from personal experience their customer support service has been efficient and straight to the point.",Jack ,2021,6,14,3,0,0.1,Positive

I love all their ads about the stable and fast network buahahahahah,"Unfortunately the truth is their network is a joke, keeps freezing for a few seconds every 15-30 minutes while the router is literally 2m from me. The ping is between 39-70ms which makes it poor AF  in any online games but as I said before, when it`s freezes the ping is 300ms. Literal rubbish, that`s what this is. Thankfully I don`t pay a penny for it but if I`d I`ll hire an attorney as this is a joke dude.",P.K.,2021,5,30,1,0.095,0.12,Positive
STAY AWAY,"Where to start, signed up for BT fibre optic on the 19th April they said an engineer will be out on the 4th may for installation (bearing in mind that's 15 days in total for them to inform you if they cannot do anything). 4th may comes, no engineer and old provider disconnects my service as BT takes over my line. Call BT to ask what's going on, their reply "" we are so sorry but there is no engineer scheduled and we dont know when"". Working from home and this is the last thing you want to hear. I spoke to the complaints team, its been a month and to this day they don't know if they are able to get a line in. Effected my work immensely and to top it off just a sorry no compensation for my time and struggle . AVOID BT at any cost, only good thing you can say is just the agents who are polite but overall as a company its just complete utter nonsense. Virgin media tells you on their site if they can or cant put a line through. If they told me on the day I signed up and didn't bounce me around like a tennis ball I wouldn't have joined them.UPDATE: 15/06/21: TWO months and no broadband, provided me with cheap copper to get me off their back! No apology, no compensation. As I finally changed providers and they have given me a go live date, BT closed my complaint as I don't have any service with them anymore. To top it off sent me a bill for £236 for a something they didn't provide. Man I really wish if I could take this further!! I had to upgrade my phone package to hotpot everything.

Didnt turn up, chased, one was finally delivered next day after my call to chase where the hub was (packaging clearly stated only sent the day before….). Drove 180 miles to property to install, no broadband cable/filter was supplied in box and there was no indication anywhere that it was needed. It wasn’t in the hub box and the engineer who fitted the line did not leave one or mention it. Given 15 quid compensation to go and buy my own... BT was aware this was a 2nd property 180 miles from my home and i have a day job so not easy to sort. Cost me time and money. Now don’t have the opportunity to set broadband up for another couple of weeks. Been a car crash from start to finish. BT are not professional, the only sense I got was from telephone support, the online chat feature through the BT app isnt fit for purpose.

I have had no Wifi except for about 5 minutes after switching on.I hav'nt been able to use my laptop or table since last year.I have paid over £200 for having the computer checked. He can't do it remotely as before because he can't get into my system remotely.Openreach and BT don't communicate. Twice I have been given an engineer appointment and he has turned up without the necessary components.I was then texted that ""we shall be changing you over to Digital Recognition your landline will then be as efficient as your Broadband"".It was like a death knell. I managed to finally get through to someone to say don't touch it. I need the landline its the only bit that works and since I have frequent power cuts my landline is linked to Scottish Power so all I have to do is telephone them and I will get details of the outages and when they will be fixed. I was called a liar - ""telephones don't work it the power is off"". But they promised to keep away from my telephone system.3 days later I got a text from someone in Newcastle saying I had to have the new system.On the Friday a friend came rushing up at lunchtime to say he had been phoning since 8.30 and thought I might be in some danger.The phones were not working. The power was off and the phones.Then I found out that they had switched over on that day without telling me.I had no phones for three days and had arguments with them in which they said my telephones wouldn't work on the new system so they would have to provide me with a new hub and new phones.The engineer arrived to do this (my choice) as I thought that they would have no excuse to call me stupid and incompetent if they fitted them.They did not work. The following day and for 4 days I could not make calls out and when anyone phoned it switched off after the second ring. Their excuse: it must have been a nuisance call.Wednesday I got in touch with an 'expert' on the complaints network.She told me that they had no right to change me over. That they could supply me with battery which would hold a charge for a few hours if the electricity failed and they would send me an engineer on tuesday after the bank holiday.

DO NOT USE BT FOR SERVICES!,"I have just moved into a new property, i chose bt to provide our household services and i can tell you it was the biggest mistake of my life, my property requires a “long ladder” team for my installation to be complete which is not a problem and because of this bt had to send a engineer out to my property (kellys contractors) to complete the install, when they came they refused to set up my services because “the work was to long to do” and then also followed by a cheeky comment of “i dont get paid for this” the engineer then disappeared from my property and left with out even informing us of what was going to happen next. I then called up and made a serious complaint due to the horrendous service i received, so not only have i lost a days work and wage because i had to sit in the house all day waiting for the engineer, i was also left with no internet services and this was on May 10th. I then spoke to over 20 different people through bt customer services trying to find out what was going on and why i have not had my services installed and every single one of them told me they could not get any information on my order or when they could send someone  out to install properly. I was promised numerous amounts of call backs from managers and different memebers of staff from bt and still till this day i have not received a single call back and nearly 3 weeks have gone by.I then received a text from bt saying that they have managed to schedule an appointment to get my services installed today 28/05/2021 between 8am-1pm. So once again i booked another unpaid day off of work to sit home and wait for the engineer which i did.It them got closer to the end of my appointment slot and i had not received any call or text to confirm the engineer was coming so i rang up bt customer services just to confirm, they then proceeded to tell me that everything was good their side and a engineer should be with me shorty, they also said they was going to call openreach to confirm  with the engineer and was going to call me straight back. I once again received no call back and then received a text message saying “ Hello, BT here. Unfortunately Open Reach have rescheduled the appointment to the 3rd June 2021 AM slot between 8 and 1.  Sorry for any inconvenience caused.  Please don't reply to this text - we won't see it. Thanks.” And to make things worse, they sent me this text 10 minutes after my appointment slot, so i sat in the house again waiting and they didnt even show up. So at this point you can only imagine how thin my patients is wearing!I rang back up and once again was fobbed off with “sorry we cant help you at the moment” and “sorry we dont have any further information right now.Im sick and tired of bt and the disgraceful customer service me and my partner have been receiving. DO NOT USE BT THEY ARE THE BIGGEST SCAMMERS AND THEIR COMPANY IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHODO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THEIR JOBS, SIMPLE!

BT don’t deserve any stars but I…,"BT don’t deserve any stars but I couldn’t write this review without putting one.  Around 2 months ago I called them 3 times as my hub kept timing out.  As it was 11 years old I was told I would need a new one so a text was sent telling me my hub had been dispatched.  It didn’t arrive so I went through this process 3 times after which they admitted they had never really sent my hubs!!!!I was passed from pillar to post and ended up with a man who told me I was on an old service and could get a much better one for half price which would have been 25.00 for the phone and broadband.  I agreed to be passed to the person who could set this up for me.  He told me the service would be 67.00 and that I would need to pay 9.00 for the delivery of a new hub when it had previously been free.  I couldn’t believe the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing and they weren’t even prepared to send me the hub free of charge for previous poor service.  Needless to say I’ve left them and am with Vodafone now.  They are charging me 30.00 and I have a better service.  When I cancelled I was advised by what I think is the retention team to either send the old hub back or bin it as it was 11 years old, didn’t work and was therefore no good.  Well I binned it and today I got an envelope with a bag to return the hub in and an email telling me to return it or I would be charged 43.00.  I rang and complained telling the man on the phone I had put the old hub in the bin as advised by them and he said, ‘well you’ll just have to pay 43.00 then I didn’t advise you.’  I challenged this telling him he represents BT.  I then asked to speak to a manager but was denied this until he had found my account.  He was very sarcastic and he asked me how much I paid and what date my last payment was.  My bill differed each month so I gave an average and as I couldn’t give the exact date of my last payment he happily told me I couldn’t speak to a a manager.  They had always dealt with me before.  There are other questions they can ask.What’s sad is I am 56 years old and have been a BT customer all my adult life.  Their service used to be brilliant which is what kept me all these years.

Up-selling in the guise of fault fixing.,"I have had issues with the Wifi coverage provided by the BT Hub from the start of my contract with them.Their advice was for me was to upgrade to their complete Wifi solution, which I did but saw absolutely no benefit from doing so. In fact this solution only increased the monthly cost (nearly £80 now for FTTP), reset the duration of my contract and introduced more instability to my home network.As the solution they advised and charged for did not fix the fault, I asked for my original package to be restored to my account (remove the complete wifi I was paying a premium for as it did not fix the fault) but they refused to do so. In the end I solved the wifi problem myself by getting rid of the Home Hub and Discs and replacing them with a single quality ASUS router which is currently providing a strong G and N band signal throughout our house with no range extenders required.Hopefully this will help others considering alternatives to signing up or upgrading to whole home wifi with BT.

I wasn't even with BT at the time, and had changed to Plusnet because BT prices are extortionate. BT said I should have given them 30 days notice to change over, and that is what the £83 was for. I can't know what I don't know, so I am unaware of BT charging me £83. As soon as I knew about the charge, I paid it immediately and requested the removal of this recurring charge. Not a chance, they refused point-blank, and then arrogantly told me my case is now closed. There are no consequences for BT but huge consequences for me. BT customer service - and I use the phrase loosely - are spiteful is the word that comes to mind - if BT were a person, they'd be diagnosed psychotic.

Proudly Dysfunctional and Incompetant Organisation,"For the past 30 years I have always had to set asside 3-5 days to get any problem corrected with BT. My recent experience with BT is no exception. Apart from this organisation apparently not knowing the details of the services they offer, they also dont know the nature of the supply to your home. Their record keeping is shocking, their recourse solutions are deliberatly difficult, forcing you to spend hours on the phone trying to explain the complex and convoluted set of circumstances that have brought you to this point. Departments do not communicate with each other and do not cross refference records, this lack of centralisation demonstrates ineptitude to the extreme. However even tempered you are , dealing with these people takes you to the extremes of your tolerance, simply because you cannot believe that a National organisation can be so utterly incompetant. When they have assured you that everything has been corrected and that they will refund the money they have withdrawn from your account in error they try tricks like merely crediting your BT Balance or taking 10 days to refund you, or just dont carry out the task they assured you they would,  knowing that you will have a 45 to 90 minute wait on the phone to chase payment and you have to explain the entire scenario again. I wonder how many people have just said 'Forget it'. Any other business would go bust with this dreadful level of service. The individuals helping are always polite and obliging so keeping control is essential, its not their fault as individuals,  but the wider organisation has us over a barrel and clearly treats customers with contempt. As I said earlier, this is been the same for at least 30 years, its either deliberate or senior management dont have a single brain cell between them. Government, please provide a REAL alternative to this rabble because the current scenario where apparently there is competition, still dips a toe into BT's infrastructure.. That is where everything falls down.. Shocking!",Chris Hill,2021,5,24,1,0.07,0.054,Negative
Unbreakable? Nothing but BREAKABLE!!,"Since joining BT in November 2020, I have had nothing but difficulties and bad inconsistent communication.

I have had my internet completely go down numerous times, without any true resolution other than to leave me without internet for minimum of 2 weeks then its 'fixed' to only be repeated a month later. I have spent HOURS!! on the phone and no one really can take responsibility for the failures. I had my internet go down the evening before my medical exams. Meaning I had to go to a cafe to sit professional exams. This service is simply unacceptable, and I would not recommend any one switching or even considering using BT as a provider.

Misleading BT adverts as WiFi not guaranteed,"Switched from EE to BT in December partly due to price comparison but partly due to BT adverts about their ‘unbreakable WiFi’ which the adverts suggest is guaranteed. I’ve never had such poor internet since the switch. Weekly phone calls, emails, communication via social media, 3 engineers sent to the house (all say house set up, wiring etc fine but the BT router to blame), had new equipment sent, lots of switching channels. Told to buy an Ethernet cable and use that which is now the only way I can access the internet. Not much help to other devices. Every person I speak to states BT does not guarantee WiFi. So the adverts are misleading. Each engineer told me there is an issue with the BT equipment which is common knowledge and they’ve been trying to create a patch to sort but still waiting. I’ve been paying for BT ultimate for over five months and only able to access internet via a dangerously trailing cable through house. Whole set up and number of plugs required is ridiculous. BT technical support now suggest I buy alternative hub from Amazon, more similar the the EE one as they’re of better quality and may sort my issue. No money returned under their WiFi ‘guarantee’ as they keep telling me, it’s not guaranteed. And they tell me I can’t leave contract fo return to EE.",Mrs Helen Hackett,2021,5,23,1,0.08,0.077,Negative

British Telecom Dirty tricks in operation.                BT. accept sign up for contracts via…,"British Telecom accept sign up for contracts via telephone conversation. If you want to cancel at anytime they will not accept cancellation in the same way. They also withhold that fact and continue taking payments from your bank. Even if you can prove no use of the service they can justify keeping the money they have taken as the service is provided weather used or not. They are protected by the ombudsman who supports that position.   Anyone can fall into the trap of having your direct debit continued for me it was £1,700 they took without my knowledge. To add insult to injury they will then add cancellation fees and if not paid they will chase you through debt collection agencies. Ruining your credit rating as well as stealing your money. The reason I cancelled with them?  Simply that once you start your contract even when your equipment becomes outdated and breaks down they will only replace it with the same model that is not fully functioning due to system upgrades. Once your equipment starts to go wrong they will not supply the latest tech equipment to existing customers only to new ones for free.",Dear Mr Edwards,2021,5,23,1,0.128,0.077,Negative

ThenI phoned BT and told them I've already been confirmed that they stop the services, via phone support.I wanted to get the transcript to prove that, but the team always refused to send that.I don't have the time to go to a lawyer and sue this dreadful company, so I gave these 45£ despite my router and TV have been disconnected ever since my end of contract.I have returned the tv and broadband as requested, I have the proof of it. I receive an email today that I amabout to pay 60£ for the tv receiver as they did not receive this, although it is in the same bag.

BT missold broadband package to elderly Mum…,"I've just discovered that BT sold my 90 year old Mum a broadband and mobile package in 2016. My Mum doesn't know what broadband is! BT don't hold records of the call from 6yrs ago but are saying my Mum agreed to the package. If no broadband router was visible on their network with a related IP address and no 'phone calls shown against the sim they sent her you'd think this would have been noticed over a 6 Yr period! If not, why not! They have been charging her all this time and now say she is only able to receive a max refund of 6mths broadband. So the offer is a couple of hundred pounds and she's paid out over £2,000. There is no way my Mum understood what this package was - if somebody had asked her if she used the Internet she'd have said NO and that would have been the end if the call. Therefore she must have been coerced into buying this without understanding what they were offering. Appalling ...and so is their customer service.",Northern Soul,2021,5,15,1,0.104,0.014,Negative

Had an engineer come over to ""improve"" the speed and all that happened in the next 2 days was my download speed dropping down to 3mbps and my upload down to 0.7mbps. When I asked them to do something about it, the technician team simply replied that upload speed cannot be guaranteed and ""one only needs it if he works at a space station"" which makes me think that they do not have the required knowledge to carry out a job in the technician team department.

"If I could give less than 1 star, I would.","If I could give less than 1 star, I would.Had our subscription cancelled when we moved house as our new property couldn't offer us the same Wifi deal we had, so they wanted the same costs per month for worse wifi. Had multiple discussions over the phone with different agents that gave us different statements of our final bill, so we waited for our final bill to arrive on email before paying, as agreed over the phone. After a couple of weeks, we were hit with a Debt Recovery company asking us for almost £1000 to cover our BT costs. After phoning BT, they said they had no records of the phone conversations that we had had, despite the emails we had proving they exist. We were also told our final bill was around the £300 mark for the cancelation fee which we said we would pay, only to be told that it was actually £770 by the next person we spoke to after being transferred through. During our time with BT, their services stopped working for around 2 months and we were promised a new TV box, instead, we just had to watch TV through the Sky Go app on my PlayStation connected to my parents account. They still expected us to pay the full amount during this time of course despite their services not working. BT also took our money and then told us our services would be activated in just over 2 months at the start of our contract. After telling them this was unacceptable as both myself and my partner need wifi to work from home, I was told nothing could be done and no one could get their services fitted or activated any quicker. I phoned sky who said they could fit everything and have an engineer in our property in 7 days, I told BT and amazingly, out of absolutely no where, we had our services booked to be activated in 5 days.

You'll be on the phone for an hour every time you call, being passed from department to department to eventually be told ""we're still waiting for an update from the connections team - and no, sorry we don't know when that will be, we can't speed up the process, and we can't escalate this further as a complaint has already been raised"". They sent us a mini-hub in the meantime but it gets about 2mbps, which is fine for browsing and emails, but good luck if you have do to a Zoom call.

Excellent,"Got to speak as I find.  We have been with several ISPs and in terms of actual product BT is by far the best.  The router is way better than the others as well.  We can only get copper here at moment except Virgin that I will not go back to.  They handled the switch from previous ISP no problem.   An openreach fault blacked out area just after we switched, not BT issue, they sent us 4g hub to keep us on line (no one else does that) and diverted our calls to our SKY mobile.  Got sign up credit early and credit for fault without asking.  Plus apology without even having to call due to network area fault.   Superb service from BT.

Disgusting Customer service.,"Disgusting service. This is the second time I've had major issues with BT. I was forced to stay with them as I was tied into contract. They came and ""installed"" my phone line when I moved house. Everything was fine unless it rained heavily and by router would flash orange and my phone would ring by itself and crackle. It would always resolve after the rain dried up. But in Feb after big storms it was doing it too often so I rang to report it. That's when the problems began. On my 40th birthday they arrived and immediately stated they were not a fiber engineer and only sent to restore my phone line. He told me I shouldn't have mentioned the loss of dialinv tone and crackling if I wanted a broadband engineer.... How the hell was I to know that !?He stated he was only responsible to restore my line where it entered the house which was in my child's bedroom. But when I'd moved in the engineer had bypassed this and put my master socket in the living room via an extension. This new engineer stated he wasn't happy with the work the previous engineer had done and was taking it all away and left me with my house phone and router in my 3 yet olds bedroom in her play corner... This meant to WiFi in the living room and having to disconnect the house phone every time my child needed to sleep so I rang up to complain. The lady I got was lovely and promised another engineer would come out and I wouldn't be a penny out of pocket... If only that ended up being true....In the day of the first appointment in march they never showed up then messaged to cancel but I'd already used a days leave from work. They rebooked for 6th April. Finally I had my master back in my living room. But then came the bills.£185 came off my bank without me knowing causing me bank charges. I was 2 hours on the phone being passed like a ping pong ball between faults and billing. I was offered £15 good will gesture... Then when I said that wasn't good enough they said they had done all the can and just hung up on me.Mever known such disgusting service.",Jennifer Hughes,2021,4,27,1,0.072,0.062,Negative

By this time my patients was blowing so called again and again an appointment was made and I was promised by Jodie that the install would go ahead at the planned date (another 2 weeks) and the text message confirmed this, only minutes later to receive another text say sorry we cant attend this date, next appointment is 3 weeks.

Liars!!!!,"I started a contract for the 1st time with them back in December 2020, they’ve installed it and everything was fine, then the nightmare started.Since end of January/early February I have been reporting the same issue all over again, the connection drops randomly during the day, multiple times, for at least 25 mins cutting me off from work or any online activities but most important from work!!!An avarage of 20 mins at least 5 times a day means almost 2 hours per day spent without working!!!! They sent out countless engineers so far and the problem is still there. If I check my error logs from the router it says “ WAN connection WAN2_INTERNET_PTM disconnected.[ERROR_NO_CARRIER]” every time the connection drops but I guess anyone as even bothered to check what this error means.The worst worst thing happened this week, once again the issue happens, I call them they promise me an engineer for the next day 8am-1pm they said. 3pm and nobody is here, I call them and find out that the person that was supposed to come called sick but nobody told me or found a replacement engineer, so they tell me they will send another one by 6pm the very same day (Still waiting for this last one!!!).I open a fault on their website, speak to an advisor (again) and this time I’m promised that either this engineer fixes the problem or they allow me to leave them without any fee. This was supposed to happen today 26/04, the engineer didn’t show up, I tracked the fault online and discovered they closed it as “fixed” and the engineer marked the visit as “completed”. Liars!THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY!!!! The result is that I tried to get in touch with them this morning and the live chat was n/a and the automatic voice wouldn’t put me through an advisor as usual.

Open Reach enginneer attended to do installation however, no new hub had arrived in time. However, the Open Reach engineer informed us that it did not matter as he would onle be doing the outside installation as he could not come into our home and do the internal installation and another engineer would come back another date to do this. Contacted BT and informed them of the above we were given another date 13th April 2021. Contractor for Open Reach came to finish installation shoddy outside work and could not connect us as stated problem with connection on Telephgraph pole would need to come back later that day with another person to fix problem on pole, never returned.

WORST provider on the market,"Awful company. I knew this before I even got a contract with them. My house is a new build and only BT support with internet so I had no choice. I had a 24 month contract with them from August 2019 and never missed a payment until earlier this year due to COVID reasons, they said it’s fine just pay one month and we’ll give you one month free. I paid and they never gave me a month free. Went to disconnect my services for “not paying” I phone up, they said they can’t do nothing as I hadn’t paid in time, phoned up again and they said “no worries we’ve stopped the cancellation and your services will remain active” and they did for 7 days and they just deleted my account. I phone up, they said “it’s gonna take 2 weeks to get it activated again”. So I had to get a new account made, I was forced into another 24 month contract and all the advisor could do was sell me more things that I didn’t want! I raised a complaint and had it escalated to the manager FIVE DAYS AGO. I was supposed to get a call-back the following day from the manager. It’s been nearly a WEEK and the manager hasn’t called me. I’ve phone them every day since the complaint and the advisors have told me “the manager seems to be avoiding your complaint as it’s top of the queue”. They’ve sent me a 4G mini hub in the mean time and now they’ve disconnected that too! I pay £64 a month for my BT package of “average 900mbps download and 450mbps guarantee” my speeds have never gone above 300mbps, absolute SCAM!

I ask, 'can you check and confirm with him please?'  answer - ' no', this is now out of our hands.  Well you're not a 'connection' team then are you, you are sales people.   Then to cap it all off, I ask ' the engineer presumably has the router?' answer - 'no, you already have a BT router?'  No, I am a new bloomin' customer!  I ask you.  Do I recommend BT?  Not at this point.  Oh and by the way, they charge you £19.99 for this connection service.  My advice.  Don't take the comparison sites as gospel, it's all down to making money.

"Well, where to begin!","So, we were moving house and it cost us over £300 to leave BT as we were contractually bound to them for another year so very unfortunately we had to take them with us. The lady on the phone advised me I needed a whole new box (which looks a lot like the other one) and I had to post the old one back. To instal this new box we needed an appointment with an engineer, which is difficult when you both work full time and the engineer doesn’t work evenings or weekends, so one of us booked the day off. The engineer arrives, he raffs for a while then says we need another part so he will be back in 5 minutes, this was at 4:45pm. We ring the engineer again at 5:55pm and ask him where he is, the engineer advises that he’s waiting for his “mate” to bring the part then he will come back. Needless to say, he never came back. So we ring BT the next morning who Ofcourse were completely unaware of the situation. After another faff over the phone, we have to book another engineer appointment, and one of us has to take another day off work. Now I don’t know if any of you have kids but to have their class teacher off for 2 days because their BT engineer is crap at his job is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. Anyway, because BT are known for their “great” customer service they’ve offered me £30 in account credit for my troubles. Which doesn’t add up to the wage I lost for taking those 2 days off by the way and definitely does not compensate my troubles! So, if anyone is looking for a broad band provider, please don’t choose BT - I’m stuck with them, the only thing I can do is encourage other people not to be!!",MR,2021,4,21,1,0.082,0.048,Negative
"If you like ever increasing bills, go BT !!","Having been with BT for years I can say that from a service performance point of view I've had no issues. Billing however is quite different, every six months your bill will increase. Bi-annually this occurs and yet no representative can tell who or where this is decided you just have to pay up or buy out of the contract. Never as a long standing/loyal customer will you ever be paying the same as a new customer nor will they ever fix the price for the term of the contract. Leaves a very bitter taste not to be a valued customer just a revenue stream/number. Poor really.",Neil Haddow,2021,4,21,1,0.131,0.021,Negative
Internet connection has been abysmal…,Internet connection has been abysmal despite having two engineers try to fix it. Was wrongly charged £120 one month. And took 2 hours on hold and BT hanging up the call three times until it was finally resolved! BT has been really really poor since it was installed two years ago. They sent an engineer out last year when lock down eased up after months of failed connection whilst trying to home school and work from home. Engineer said the external wire they had installed the previous year (only months earlier) had completely rusted. They said the issue wasnt my fault and i also wouldn’t have to pay for the internet that month as i had had over six months of either zero or poor connection. Instead.. i was charged £120 that month?! Internet has still been poor since then (often 1mb if im lucky when i was told minimum would be 35mb and i pay for 40mb) we don’t use many devices and it often struggles to work when im just answering emails. I dont live in a rural area either. They sent another engineer out this week. When looking through my account I realised I had been wrongly charged the £120 from september last year (months after the engineer had even been out) I hadnt realised at the time as we had a family member pass away that month and my mind was elsewhere. Took me 2 hours (and BT disconnecting my call 3 times) until i finally got through to a nice man who apologised profusely and was able to finally sort it out. The first girl was really quite rude and blatantly just hung up after asking me to wait for 40 mins. I thought maybe the line had disconnected but when it happened three times with other people i realised that wasnt the case. What an unpleasant way to deal with paying customers who are being polite and waiting patiently? To have to be on hold for 2 hours and deal with 7 different people to rectify an error on their behalf is really poor. What a poor service except for the nice man at the end who finally helped me get my money back and refused to put me on hold because i said id been hung up on by the company three times!,Miss M,2021,4,21,1,0.104,0.033,Negative

BT (bloody terrible!),"BT - useless robbing b******s!! I only gave one star - because it won't let me give no stars. I have been a customer for around 27 years - and have had broadband with them for around 18 years. I do live in a rural area - and so do not expect perfect service - but theirs has been truly shocking. When they came out with 'BT Infinity' a number of years ago, we tried to sign up for it to improve our lot - but unfortunately it was not available in our area. Eventually it did become available - and we signed up to receive the 100Mbps advertised - except that the small print said that we could only really expect 24-36Mbps - and the even smaller print said that they would only actually guarantee 17Mbps. Anyway, we saw no actual improvement - but some years later they launched 'Halo' - which was going to infinitely improve things. No it didn't. After probably 5-6 years of 'Infinity' - having films constantly freeze or drop out while we're trying to watch them - or teenagers screaming down the stairs because their game has just frozen 'again' - we decided it was time to try an alternative. So we arranged to change over to Truespeed - 350Mbps guaranteed direct fibre - for £16/month less than the robbers at BT charge for their 17Mbps. I duly phoned to inform BT that we would be leaving, and was told that after my 27 years of loyal service, they were going to reward me with a £128 charge for cancelling their contract early. I was not too happy with this, so decided that I would also cancel the landline, the BT TV, and the four mobile phones that we have with them as well. I have just received my regular bill with all of the regular charges - so phoned to ask why, when we stopped using all of their services over the last 1-2 weeks? They apologised, and said they would wipe the bill - however, there would still be a cancellation charge. I said that was fine - I'd already been told it would be £128. No, they said, it will be £398!!! For cancelling a service that was complete b******s for the whole 18 years that we had it?!? I just spent an hour on the phone - utterly pointlessly arguing my case. These w*****s have you over a barrell - because if you don't pay (and they intend to 'take' their money within 7 days) - they will simply f*** up your credit rating - and still hound you until you pay - so I just have to bite the bullet while they dip their greedy hands in to my bank account one last time. I would strongly advise that no-one ever uses BT for anything - ever. We now have Truespeed for broadband and landline, Sky for TV, and EE for mobile (yes I know they're owned by BT - but their deal was £13/month less than BT - with more data) - and we can't believe the difference in the quality of all of those services - it's been like stepping out of the dark ages - and all for around £28/month less than those robbing f*****s were charging us for all those years - w**k s****s - the lot of them! £5 prize to the first person who figures out what all the blanked out words are (unless you work for BT - you lot have had quite enough of my money thank you!)",Andrea,2021,4,20,1,0.08,0.097,Positive

I had Ian from Liverpool financing make me cry with his impatient and rudeness. PLEASE, if you are thinking BT — RUN FOR THE HILLS. Everyone, please check the Automatic Compensation Scheme that BT signed up to in April 2019. They will try and owe you bare minimum but they have an agreement with OFCOM regarding this.

For any issue the BT solution is for the customer to pay more!!,"Been with BT for 4 years on a full package (TV, phone, broadband).  In the past 4 weeks devices are randomly dropping off the internet connection, including a 3 week old phone, a 4 yo Kindle,  6 mo Ring security and my Diabetes management software.  The only way to reconnect them is about twice a week I have to turn the router off and do a factory reset then reconnect the devices manually.  Explained it's a security risk as I can't rely on Ring and a serious health risk when not able to use my Diabetes management devices / software - BT's answer - you can pay for a better router and upgrade to the most expensive broadband package so you have a better chance of keeping connection.If they would have offered to replace the 4 yo router for free I probably would have stayed with them on the full package for another 4 years or so, but I'm off to another provider as for any BT issue their suggested fix seems to be that the customer needs to pay more, despite paying them over £5000 while I've been a customer",Kerry Edwards,2021,4,20,1,0.04,0.063,Positive

The network in contact departments is a real nightmare.,"I have been a BT customer since 2014, I recently moved from home, and the service I received has been a nightmare, I made the change of address through their service on the web and up to here everything seemed correct, but he sent me the new router to the old address, i had to take several phone calls and waiting 24/48 h for my address to be updated correctly, on several occasions they told me that they would contact to me and they never did, I had to called again and again, a 45 minutes waiting and they transferred the call again and again to other departments, in total the calls took me hours, and it was impossible to find a solution.I just needed a visit from a enginner and this was denied again and again, finally I had to change provider, when i went to cancel my contract ,  appeared another new account that delayed 15 days more my activation with my new provider. Then i had to cancel two contracts. All this lasted two months. Finally the day came with the new provider, I was able to contact via chat with the technical service, and it only took them ONE DAY to send a enginner: The resolution is quoted as such ""Misrouted connection corrected"" this would make it a none-chargeable visit  .

Avoid BT - what 4 months of being a customer really means.,"* An Openreach engineer attended premises where my flat is and removed my broadband connection or FTTC connection on Friday 9th April resulting in no service for my connection. * I booked an engineer for the fault at my property for Monday 12th April  (Name of engineer was Bilhal)– who informed me of the situation outlined in point 1. He then proceeded to leave after 20 mins, and was overheard on the phone saying, “he did not know what the fault was” and then informed me to order a new hub.* A new hub arrived and surprise, surprise, there is still a fault. Another 45 min call with customer service to book a new engineer on 15th April. * 15/04: after clearing my schedule for the appointment, I log onto bt.com to be informed that the engineer visit is ""complete"" with an added green tick - as if everything is resolved. No communication to me, not even an attempt at an apology.* Cue then another hour conversation with your customer service to be told that the appointment was moved, and no-one can attend until Monday 19th April, and that ""hands are tied"". *  16/04: Called again to see if anything can be done for an earlier appointment - told yes, we can get engineer to you on 17/04. It’s all confirmed and booked * 17/04 - no engineer. No contact and again only discovered when logging onto bt.com. The customer service rep admitted that engineers are not bothering to turn up to appointments and marking them as completed visits. Gaslighted me when I told him I’ve never had this issue with Sky / inferring that I’m making it all up and finally, to top it all off, threw his colleague under bus by saying that my appointment for 17/04 was never confirmed. At this point, don’t know whether to laugh or cry. Also, that I should just complain to the ombudsman * 19/04 - another missed engineer who at 8.03am said he visited the property and fixed the fault. Another 1 hour and 15 min call to be told that someone did attend. Now they have to book another engineer. But this time, it’s a manual process. She has to email someone to book it and they are going to call me to arrange an appointment. It’s now 10 days of no broadband and clearly they just expect me to accept this. I’ve emailed the CEOs of both BT and Openreach and neither of them take any responsibility. The worst part is they sent me a £30.05 compensation as if that would smooth everything over.

Where do I start with BT,"Where do I start with BT? They're the most dreadful company to deal with, not merely with their horrendous customer service but the chaos that is their engineering, investment, and willingness to help their customers. We have had broadband with BT for 16 years, and it has progressively been getting worse. We used to get 76MB per second on our line, which is terrible, but to other individuals in my county, it would be a fantasy. However, for us, it's been getting slower and slower with more people adopting fibre, which is understandable to an extent. Although what I find most baffling and disingenuous is they sneakily keep reducing my guaranteed speed. However, I still get that increase with every new contract and their pitiful CPI increases, which is bizarre considering inflation is 2% lower. Furthermore, they're not using the money to invest in my area; their engineers have told me on multiple occasions they won't support it. I know Virgin Media have had their issues, but they're investing in my town, and when it's complete, I'm migrating to Virgin Media. Also, a future note to anyone considering BTTV - don't, it a catastrophe. We’ve had Sky for 25 years, and I've seen how dreadful and unreliable BTTV is.",Richard,2021,4,11,1,0.149,0.059,Negative
Reliable line and wifi but terrible admin,"I will leave a mixed review. I have found that my line and internet have been very reliably provided (though this hasn't been the case for a friend who recently joined - two losses of line in the first 2 months) but the main problem is administrative. Last summer (2020) I negotiated a new package and my bill was wrong 5 times consecutively. I spent a huge amount of time setting this right (we are now on track) and was told it was the fault of the algorithms or computer or somesuch. But human beings put the initial info in so that's no excuse. My current beef is on behalf of someone else and though it's been rectified, I want to alert everyone out there: even when a line fault is not the fault of the homeowner but of BT, if the engineer goes into your house, you are automatically charged. In my friend's case, the little BT Openworld box had been wrongly wired at the outset but my friend found an £85 charge on her next phone bill. We appealed it for her (she is pretty deaf hence hard for her to do these things) and BT refunded it, plus a 'financial apology' for the 12 days she had  no line. But it should not have been charged for in the first place - it was BT's fault! Someone on 150 told me - if they go into your house, you will be automatically charged. You have to appeal. Sorry BT - this is 'wide boy' tactics! So BT customers - be aware and do not pay this charge if it was a BT fault! And ensure you get compensation for days your phone was out of order through no fault of your own.

It should not take 2 months to install Fibre broadband in 2021 London,"With Virgin Media somehow not being available in a very populated area of London (SW4), I had no choice but to take out a BT/Openreach internet connection to work from home. I was told that fibre was not available and an advisor advised me to get the regular broadband and upgrade when it was available.I bought the basic (20Mbps) broadband, however it took 2 weeks to get the install date, and then a further 6 weeks for the order to be 'finalised'. I spoke to 3 BT customer representatives that told me that an order takes 24 hours to finalise from the installation- why it took 6 weeks I'll never know. They said this was something that Openreach are in control of but BT kept awfully quiet and gave me 2 follow up texts with a blanket apology. For the inconvenience, they issued me five whole pounds (£5) once I raised a complaint. Had I had gone with another provider (which relies on the BT/Openreach infrastructure) I would have had Fibre broadband installed 3 weeks ago.Now that fibre is available in my area it looks like BT are at it again with the miscommunication. As a student I'm entitled to a 9 or 12 month contract, however after waiting 2 hours on hold to get through, one advisor told me I'd get a 'call back', which I didn't. I rang again and was passed off to 3 people, in which someone in (what I assume was) the retention department was able to put me on the student contract or something. I have no idea but essentially what the BT advisor told me from day one was apparently incorrect, and I'd be entering another contract with a second credit check and an even further 2 weeks install time.

Eventually got put through to someone who admitted there was an issue that had been created by them but he said he could not prioritise the call and it would just have to wait until the 6th April when they were scheduled to correct it.WHY CAN BT NOT PRIOROTISE FAULTS CAUSED BY THEM AND PUTTING VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS AT RISK - BT CEO WELCOME TO RESPOND!It is now the 7th April. Issue still not resolved. BT blaming OpenReach and now saying it will be fixed on the 9th?? Will it, or will it be a further excuse and told to wait until the following week.This has caused my father-in law untold stress, It has wasted loads of NHS time as they have been constantly calling to schedule his urgent appointments.

I must have spent upwards of 15 hours per annum waiting on either phone, chat, often both at the same time.I was so relieved to move to finally cancel my last BT services. Still I got another bill today.The BT sports service I wanted to cancel at a certain date because I still wanted to see some boxing. That service got cancelled immediately.Our broadband was more often not available than available.BT engineers were booked, holiday was taken, the engineers never showed.

Horrid experience after bereavement,"All I can write that is constructive is that BT is like the old nursery rhyme about the little girl with a curl in the middle of her forehead. When she was good she was very, very, good and when she was bad she was horrid. My husband has been with BT for many years. We now have fibre broadband and all was well until his death in early February this year. I could write a book about the saga of useless phone calls, unacknowledged letters and death certificate to BT’s office in Durham. Instead of putting the account in my name, as is reported on the Martin Lewis’s forum and BT’s own Community Forum, one ends up with a shared account, and then one gets ripped off, like with my husband’s mobile contract which should be invalid after his death, is still being added to ‘our’ bill. Even tho’ I told BT in February to remove it, today I learnt I have to give a month’s notice.

The stink from BT is from the time it had a monopoly in the UK, before it was privatised by Maggie Thatcher.In my case my family has held a certain phone number for more than years. BT has no policy for landlords that wish to temporarily let their homes, and retain their historic phone number. I tried complaining to the Ombudsman, but they astonishingly were useless, it seems that BT and the Ombudsman have a cosy relationship.My only hope is the Starlink, or one of those other satellite systems will finally kill off BT.

Leave well alone,"AVOID, LEAVE WELL ALONEWe moved to our new home last October and have had nothing but problems with slow broadband, managing only 0.8mbps at best.  Countless phone calls and faults raised nothing got sorted. All this time we were paying the full broadband and call package. We were told by BT that if they couldn't resolve our issues we had the right to exit WITHOUT PENALTY in January.  To cut a very long story short - lots of phone calls - it didn't get resolved so told them we were going to leave end of February. March's bill was for calls and broadband and now we have had a bill for £610.00 because we left our contract early! So much for broadband speed code of practice. Firstly it was BT unable to resolve the slow broadband and provide us with speeds they said we should achieve and secondly who has that sort of money just to give to BT or anyone else for dire service. We have been told today that there are plenty of notes on our account that we shouldn't be charged and they will issue a new bill in the next 24 hours.  I'm not going to hold my breath, mind you it might stop that sick feeling.   Our fault records have been deleted -  bit of advice keep records, screen shots etc.  Disgraceful I'm so upset and angry that they do this to customers time and time again, just shouldn't be allowed, if I ran a business like this well I wouldn't have one for long.

They just DON'T care about customers!,"I've called many time for serveral issues, not only the wait time to actually speak to someone takes forever but when you finally get through they pass you onto someone else to deal with your issue. What is the point of the selection using the numbers on the phone to get through to the right deparment?? Anyways, so you end up having to re-explain everything so another person. What finally did it for me was waiting on the call for just over 1hr and then when they finally transferred me over to the correct department and went through the security questions (again!), the phone line just cut! So you'd expect the BT agent to call u back but no, this individual did not even bother to try call me back! So I ended up having to wait on the phone again to speak to someone which took me 42 minutes. The fact he knew, i was incorrectly charged (that's how far we got on the phone), he didnt even bother to ring back to resume sorting out the issue. Now if this was the one off case, i wouldnt not bother to right this review, but the fact its been many times where BT have just shown they don't care. Have they become so big, they think they don't have to care anymore?I've also noticed (again been through several issues with BT) that they say they update the system to reflect a change on your account that was discussed and agreed but to later discover these changes were not done or on put on the account on time which resulted in several wrong charges to my card. This means, you have to constantly chase them to correct the amount which then means having to go through the long phone calls again. Honestly, it never ends...... Also, believe or not, BT have charged me more when my deal ended, they don't bother to notify you. Just hope that people forget so they can charge you more! Cheat! So many other providers are honest and up front, not BT! I know this because friends and family have notified me. Never again, all broadband, mobile and TV are being switched!

Dismal customer service from start to…,"Dismal customer service from start to finish. Couldn't order advertised package (fibre with unlimited calls) - this seems a cynical ploy by BT to gain extra revenue when new customers go over a lower tariff (700 minutes) on the basis that it's your best fit. At 23p per minute this could prove very expensive if you forget to change your tariff, which amazingly is possible once the service is live, but not before (Ofcom take note!). After a transfer fiasco that knocked out the phone line (not a single BT advisor suggested to check that even if the router has no power, if the broadband cable has been connected to an ethernet port it will knock out the whole phone line). I was trying to sort this out for my elderly mum and was told an engineer would call in 24 hours as she was deemed to be a welfare customer (with an emergency/support phone service which obviously no longer worked). 48 hours later an engineer came and immediately spotted the error - very common apparently. Why BT Customer Services do not try to diagnose this fault over the phone is a mystery. It would be super easy to do, esp in the middle of a pandemic to avoid unecessary call outs. You obviously expect the broadband not to function, but when the phone line goes dead too and the router isn't even switched on - well, who knew). A tiny investment in diagnostics training would greatly improve customer service/customer experience. In the end BT charged an unadvertised £85 call out fee and further £19.99 set up fee (mum's had her line rental with them since BT became an entity - so much for customer loyalty!). After a very long phone call these charges were refunded and the advisor was helpful and apologetic to be fair.

The BT '''''''''Guarantee''''''''',"So my problem with BT is probably not as serious as others but it is very worrying I think. I receive their 'Fibre' broadband which isn't Fibre because nobody has dug up my garden to replace the wires yet and my anticipated download speed is 50mb or there abouts, its nowhere near proper Fibre so misleading. Which leads to my issue. My 'guaranteed' download speed is 40mb and I pay them for that but my actual download speed, according to their own speed app is 24mb. Now you could argue my broadband is still working and I am getting a reasonable speed to be able to do a lot of things so whats the problem. Well the problem is I am paying for a service which I am not receiving, a service which they in their own words 'guarantee' and it got me thinking. How many people out there are paying extra for these 'guaranteed' speed and not receiving close to it? My guess is quite a lot. I tried registering this as an issue.

BT Broadband the good and the bad!,The reliability of my service for very many years has been superb compared to neighbours messing around with clowns like Sky and TalkTalk!

So bad they gave me anxiety issues,"When I tried to move house with BT, they initially told me they could only give me a much slower speed at the new flat, so said I could leave my contract at no cost. However, instead of cancelling on the spot, they recommended I check what I could get elsewhere, as they claimed nobody else would be able to offer me a better speed anyway, so I may as well stick with them. If someone else could, they said, I could just ring back and cancel at no cost.So I did, like a fool.Finding out Hyperoptic could give me a much faster connection and had a limited time offer on I could take advantage of right now, I signed up for them, and thought I could then just ring BT to cancel like they'd said I could, like a fool.When I then rung back and tried to cancel BT, they said actually I'd have to pay about £240 to cancel. I explained the last person had said I could cancel no fee, and I wanted to hold them to that, but they held steady. Eventually, with no real way to pay a £240 fine even if I could eventually argue that I should get it back, I gave up and said I'd book in a move with them, thinking that would at least just leave me paying the same as before, like a fool.Hyperoptic were very nice about letting me cancel when I explained the mix-up, and agreed to let me keep my service with them until the date I'd booked for the BT house move, and the let me use the introductory rate they'd offered even though I was pulling out of the contract that was meant to commit me to. I think they felt sorry for how badly BT had treated me. So I organised with them to end my service on the day the BT would start, like a fool.Of course, the BT never started. Nobody turned up at the house and nothing went live. When I rang up, they said they had no record of my having talked to them about moving home (which, by this point, I'd done about 5 times). Also, apparently the service at the old place was still going and being charged (they said they'd cancel it from when I booked the move).By this point I had no internet at all, and no prospect of any for a few weeks. But the best they could do was book me in another installation and definitely cancel my old contract this time. I thought about just giving up at this point, going back to Hyperoptic, and taking the £240 fine. But I thought BT would at least arrange the move right this time, like a fool.Several weeks of no internet later, the 2nd installation date came and went with no engineer and nothing going live. Again when I rang up it was like I was asking to move home for the very first time. No record of anything. And service still going at my old place and still being charged.Worse, when I got a bill through, it turned out they'd moved me to a much more expensive contract, back-dated that to the date of our very first conversation about a home move, and removed a loyalty discount I'd previously had, and backdated that removal, and signed me up for BT Sport, and backdated that! The amount of money that went out on that direct debit was mind-bending!I then sort of lose track of it in my memory. I struggled on without internet for weeks, racking up bills on my 4G contract like nobody's business. I was job-hunting at the time and the lack of home internet was crippling. At one point, another bafflingly inflated bill full of stuff I'd never asked for and confusing additions and removals of odd amounts of money arrived an hour before a job interview, and I unwisely called up about it and had a stressful and unpleasant conversation, and got so upset a friend had to intervene, convince me to just drop it for now, and focus on the job interview (which I did not perform well in).It got to the point, even after the internet eventually started in the new place, that every time a bill came through I would suffer anxiety and delay opening it for days, fearful of what nonsense might be in it. They kept on charging me for random stuff, for months after they got the internet started up, and I kept having to call up and talk about it. I ended up in tears on several occasions. The whole experience gave me a fear of talking to companies on the phone about utility stuff that took ages to properly shake, and indirectly caused several more issues where I didn't raise problems or complain about things that were wrong because I was so scared of something like this happening.Somehow this all led to me getting locked into a 18-month contract at the new place, and once, months after the move, it was all finally humming along, they offered me a year of free BT Sport to say sorry, and I felt stupid turning it down even though it filled me with trepidation, so I took it, and of course at the end of that it took 3 tries over 3 months to cancel it. When I eventually left and moved back to Hyperoptic, it took months for me to even feel up to writing this review.Stay away from BT.",Ben Wōden,2021,4,2,1,0.138,0.083,Negative

Worse experience ever - even worse than Talktalk and that says something,"Absolutely terrible experience from the start. Mis-sold a SIM and Unbreakable broadband, despite saying I cant received EE where I live - sales person lied and said they have a booster which means I will get it! That is an absolute lie!Received the SIM - no reception, called and told I couldnt cancel SIM until after everything was set up as it was part of an ""open order"", so delayed by a week. I went on to hear this excuse rew open order many many many times that day and the next. Set up was for a new line as old line has faults on it which Talktalk failed to resolve - no new line, all attached to the faulty line. Spent 4 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved and an engineer booked in for the following day, only to be told ""computer says no"" as the order is still open. Out of sheer luck the engineer (a sub contractor, not BT Openreach) called me at about 5.50 and came to the house to check everything when I told him about the fault - he advised that he was contracted just to take over the old line, not install a new line - he was very helpful and got whatever the fault was resolved. During the calls prior to the engineer visit I was told by a really helpful woman who was trying to help resolve my issues that I have 713 BT wifi hotspots where I live so signed up immediately - no hotspot in range. Another £39 taken under false circumstances. Phoned the next day (Saturday) and was told to reduce the package to remove the halo stuff which I was mis-sold and cant use would cost £12 more than advertised, that the SIM would be cancelled and I would be transferred to another person to sort out the broadband cost. Transferred to another person only to be told that nothing can be done as there is an open order to cancel my SIM so I would have to call back on the next working day. It was only when I absolutely lost my s**t at the poor guy I was speaking to that he spoke to his manager and agreed it would all get sorted on Monday without another phone call to them. I cant believe how difficult and so utterly stressful this process has been. I can now understand why people get violent - I think I would have become uncontrollably violent if these people had been in front of me - and that is not my normal nature / presentation - I am usually calm, level headed and used to dealing with difficult situations / people. It was highly likely that I would lose my job if I didnt have a working broadband by the Monday which I explained over and over again but the only person who seemed to care about this was the helpful woman I spoke to who unfortunately wasnt able to resolve the issues for me. Thankfully the engineer sorted this for me.The last guy I spoke to re reducing the package to one I can actually use helped me get things sorted once I completely lost my mind.

CATCH 22: BT renewal nightmare - vulnerable 93 year old,"Trying to sort out renewing my vulnerable 93 year old Mum's BT contract. BT offered a new package, which seemed acceptable, but said there was an issue with the speed on the line, which they were testing at under 2mB. They agreed to sort the speed issue out via Openreach, but said they initially had to record 1-1.8mB as the guaranteed minimum speed in the documentation for the new contract package, otherwise they couldn't finalise the contract. After lots of to and fro with preliminary tests, we were issued with a 5 hour window for engineer to arrive the next day. No-one arrived. On contacting them after the 5 hours expired, the engineer booking had not been finalised. The person we spoke to made another engineer booking for three days hence. the next day, after another flurry of text and tests relating to the new booking, Openreach cancelled the new booking as 'the line is giving the minimum guaranteed speed'. Have been ages on the phone pointing out that BT only put this minimum speed in the new contract because they were obliged to put something, but that they expected us to be getting 40-50mB. BT advisor says they can't log the issue with an Openreach engineer given that it is reaching the minimum (though he accepts that this minimum is completely unacceptable), and says 'whoever sold you the package should not have done so' until the speed issue had been sorted, as Openrach can't now come because the speed matches the minimum guaranteed!!!!!.

Diabolical and Untrustworthy - Lack of any Intelligent Communication.,"Like many other people here I would give BT Minus 10 if it were possible. Appalling customer service with no real excuse for this, except that ordinary customers are not at all important.  For a communications company, there is a complete lack of any intelligent or truthful communication. Twice we have been fooled into believing that BT engineers will turn up and install a landline and WiFi in our new property where there currently isn't any of either. They also know that there is no mobile phone coverage at all in the area. So we have been left completely without any form of communication at our home. How many hours I have wasted hanging on the phone, having driven miles to get a mobile signal, waiting in the car for them to answer, the latest being too long to wait in the cold after nearly an hour. When they previously have answered, they have lied to us many times, assuring that the installation will be on the original date given, and then again after that date, when no engineers showed up, they lied again. I was assured that the manager would call me back in a given time frame - I waited and waited miles away from home to ensure I have a mobile signal, before realising I had been lied to, and that no-one had any intention of calling me. I then received a bizzare text telling me that ""the new installation date will be yesterday"". A primary school child could have written a more meaningful text. After more hours of waiting on the mobile after having driven miles to a location where there is mobile coverage, I eventually receive information and later 'confirmation' that the new installation date will be tomorrow, two days after the agreed date, between 1 and 6pm. We wait in all afternoon for the engineers, again, without any form of communication, as we can't drive to a location with mobile coverage, as we are expecting them to turn up. Both of us need WiFi to be able to work from home, as BT know. BT also did not tell us that we could use a 'hotspot' without mobile coverage, as we eventually find out ourselves. This is better than nothing, but not strong enough to support online teaching. What's next in this diabolical saga? Can you answer BT, are you there? Will there ever be an installation? Will we have to move again so soon, because we cannot work without communication? There are limited suppliers to this area and we are dependent on BT. We know that we don't matter to them.",Carolyn Kindberg,2021,3,25,1,0.051,0.061,Positive

What a disaster...,"Moving into a new flat , where the previous tenant was using BT before she moved out days before us. We also chose BT as it seemed logical and I thought it was a trusted company.

It would appear I am in the minority.,"It would appear I am in the minority.After moving to the countryside and having many issues with my previous provider, I took the plunge to use BT (fibre). For the past 2 years the internet has been constantly fast, and not had a single outage in this time.I have recently received a few emails saying it is time to renew as my 24m contract is coming to an end. The link took me to a page that showed the current packages, but I felt they were asking too much money. Yes they will provide me with 'Halo 3' with it's amazing connection promise............but my Halo 1 has never dropped the connection.I used the chat feature and verry quickly found out these are the 'new customer' prices, and because it was a renewal I was able to get a discount. So I decided to treat myself to the Fibre 900 package. The paperwork was all done online whilst on the chat with the adviser and within 10 mins the new package was all set up and the new hub will be sent out to arrive next week before my switch over.I have recently experienced terrible customer service from a couple of companies, so for this one to get it so right it has renewed my confidence that there are still some good companies out there",Motion Technical Services,2021,3,19,5,0.018,0.091,Positive

"Slow broadband, bad products, bad customer service.",I have had 2 out of 3 customer service agents who were rude and didn't know what they were talking about.The main problem has been broadband speeds being between 20MB/s and 52MB/s while paying for 74MB/s. There terrible product only guarantees 34MB/s (so it shouldn't really be advertised at 74). I have yet to receive anywhere near this advertised speed.The router they have provided is awful and needs resetting every week or so to maintain even moderate speeds.I am stuck with BT as Virgin is not in my area as I am in a new build home. as soon as Virgin is available I will be switching. 8+ years of consistent broadband speeds with Virgin and now I have to deal with a terrible and inept BT service.

My equipment arrived but it was missing a wireless plug to connect my TV.BT took £20 payment out of my bank account.The router still didn't work and gave me a signal to say no connection.I phoned BT, I was on hold for a total of 50 mins and spoke to 3 people before someone said they would call me back, and they said they would send me my wireless plug.30 mins later they called back, the engineer had found a fault with the wiring and they would need to go under the road to get it fixed.The problem here is they need planning permission from the council to block half the road off, this could take a while to get. They would call me to keep me up to date.Two weeks later, I got a phone call to tell me they had permission from the council, they can close the road in three weeks, they set a date.I also asked about my plug which had not turned up. She would look into it and make sure it is sent out.The date set for the road works came and went, no engineers turned up. My wireless plug for my TV connection still has not arrived.A day after the date set, I still was not connected.I put in a complaint online about all the messing about I have had.Two days after the work was supposed to be done.

I spent another hour on the phone with them again to get my account cancelled again.

Absolute joke of a service and quality…,Absolute joke of a service and quality of broad band and line.   I had sky in my previous house and the connection was terrible.  In my new home I decided to pay double but opt for BT.  My broadband connection is awful.   I have been complaint constantly since last spring.  They suggested I upgrade which I did.   They have gave me two disks now but my device doesn’t download sitting right next to the disk.  My line is cracking and every time an engineer visits the house he claims that everything is testing fine.  The situation gets worse after each visit from the engineer.   They keep sending the same engineer who couldn’t find the fault in the first place.  They ignore my request for a SFI engineer and they make me an appointment but the engineer never shows up.    BT and Open Reach can’t communicate to even arrange a simple appointment let alone fixing the fault.   BT advertises that customers get £100 if intent doesn’t work in every room.  That is a joke and a lie too.   They can’t accept that the fault is outside my house not inside.

What customer service?!,"Beyond shocking. Originally told we could have fibre (back in nov) then this was cancelled and re ordered as copper as apprently we didn’t have fibre. This was then cancelled again and I had to ring AGAIN to re order. (All the while BT were meant to call me themselves and never did) eventually got our Wi-fi as copper but told we would get fibre in a few weeks and upgraded for free (paying £26.99) was told we would only get MAX 5MBPs on our Wi-fi. Rang BT 3 more times to confirm fibre but told 100 different things - told BT we don’t even get 1MBPs of Wi-fi. They just didn’t seem to care. Rang again on Tuesday (09/03) lovely chap most helpful so far so I thought, told me he could take £2 off my contract- £2!! But I said fine do it, (this meant a whole new contract) was passed through to complaints team (but it wasn’t it was 3 other teams) then told manager would call back the next day. This once again never happened. Called BT today and they are just utterly useless. Telling me what I already know, but also now telling me fibre was never ordered for me in the first place (so their employees have been lying to me) also thinks £24.99 is acceptable to pay for 0.03mbps of internet. Apprently will speak to open reach but could take over 2 months for a reply. Gave up in the end as was getting no where and wouldnt even offer anything else as a good will. DO NOT GO WITH BT!

Till this day..the haven’t sent out the application from, and have continued me on a full price deal. Each week I complain. Nothing. Now they say I’m tied into their 24 month contract so I can’t even leave to at least get a cheaper deal. They had no intention of putting me on BT BASIC package of around £10.07 per month, and are now charging full price of £45-£50. This is OUT OF ORDER. They dupe people. On top of this they sneakingly added a Britbox subscription- which I did not ask for, as well as threatening £50 fee to return a router which I declined with postman as I do not need of which was returned to them. Now I have little to no money. When I call, the first person never deals with it after going through a lengthy security process - they within seconds at the push a button - they transfer you to a different department and the new person you are speaking to is totally obviously - and you go through the whole darn thing again passed from pillar to post and no conclusion.

WOW what happened to BT it is a terrible service,"Account number: GB23941019I changed from Virgin media to BT because it was cheaper, I paid for an engineer to install and set up the equipment because I wanted it done properly, when he arrived, he said he does not install and set up anything other than the hub even though I had paid for the installation and set up as an extra cost. I was left with a box full of equipment that I had no idea what to do with so I did the best I could do.I had reasonably good connection for a couple of days but most of the TV channels did not work, after making a complaint a very helpful lady contacted me and help me set up some channels. A few days later I started getting really slow internet connection, my daughter could not do her schoolwork as the connection kept cutting, I could not play music because it kept freezing during every record, the TV would make weird noises and freeze, I could not download programs as they would time out. I again made another complaint as I was getting stressed out and angry with the terrible service, I was again called by a very nice lady who said they could send an engineer out in a few weeks, I said that was not good enough I had paid for a service I had not received and could not use so she then said she would send and engineer in a couple of weeks and give me £20 as goodwill, I said I am not bothered about goodwill I want the service I had paid for.I made a further complaint now because the engineer did not turn up and I waited all day for him, I still have a terrible service and wish I had never changed from Virgin despite the higher cost. This is the worst most frustrating stressful service I have ever experienced and trying and call them is impossible, terrible service.4 complaints registered with BT no reply in weeks and the engineer did not turn up, I waited in all day.

Still trying to cancel BT 10months later,I was a BT customer. It took almost 2 years to get someone out in Blackheath London to fix my broadband/landline. When they came out Nov 2019 they said it would take a specialist to fix (no real explanation) and they would need to get back to us which they never did. I changed to Virgin in March 2020. The installer fixed the issue and it took 3 hours. Great technician who works for BT Openreach. It was great to finally have broadband again. In August I had BT contacting me for arrears for unpaid invoices. They were sending emails to the BT email address which they set up and I never use. When  explained that it was closed they said they would refund me 1 month and close the account. To this date March 2021 I am still trying to close the account with British Telecom. Every 2 months they threaten my credit rating and send overdue invoices. Ever 2 months I call them and spend 2 hours on the phone trying to cancel the BT account. They always say sorry and find another department to blame. In my view BT staff are powerless and unable to complete simple tasks. It is not a well run company and you are just a number. I have asked for proof that the account is closed and they need authorization to send an email confirming this. Everything in BT needs authorization even emails. I would really like my money back and the invoices to stop but this is something I dream of. So far Virgin have been great with not even one drop in service. BT needs to change - It is 11-3-2021 and its 9.30am. I called them at 8am and I am still waiting for them to fix the invoicing issue over the phone.

BT - Incredibly poor customer service,"BT have consistently failed to deliver acceptable standards of customer service. 1. Competitive contract prices.

This had to be removed at my request. It was not mentioned that it was included as an add on. A complaint was raised.2. Cancelled my contract on the incorrect date. When moving home I informed BT I was leaving my current property and when the contract should end. They cancelled it on an incorrect date leaving me without home broadband for 2.5 weeks. Offering a 4g mini hub as an apology which has been poor. Several complaints were raised.3. Attempting to charge for a homehub. When leaving BT, BT will provide a package so that you can return the homehub to them or face a fee of £43. This was not received before the move and BT have attempted to charge for this.

Terrible service.,"Signed up for BT fibre and phone line back in October 2020. Everything went fine initially, the router was sent in good time and the service went live on the date agreed and with the speeds promised. That's where it all ends. We asked for our old number to be ported over and when we connected our phone line it wouldn't work, cue us calling CS almost every week until we finally had enough a couple of weeks ago. Every time we called we were passed to different people who 'promised' to get the issue fixed.. this never happened. We were then told it was an issue with Openreach and that if we left BT we'd have the same issue with other providers. So stupidly we let them 'try' to resolve the issue which carried on until the end of Feb. After all this time we'd had enough so cancelled the service. We're now with NowTV and guess what?!

if you call 0800 800150 make sandwiches because you'll be there for 2 hours!,"I have been with BT for many years for both landline and broadband. I recently moved house and was promised my new landline and broadband would be up and running by midnight 26th February. At around 10:30 pm my landline duly went live (great) but no sign of broadband. Next day I called to say I had no broadband and called the only number they offer 0800 800150 and that's when the madness started. First it was a 40 minute wait to get the call answered, only to find that the person answering could not deal with my problem and had to transfer me, which involved another 40 minute wait. After spending about an hour on the line I was promised a resolution, which did not happen. Next day, another call, another 40 minute wait, another transfer, another 40 minute wait another failed promise. This happened repeatedly over the next few - on one call I managed to speak to call handlers in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland; each one part of the team that could solve my problem, each one failing to do so. Don't worry, I hear you say, you're a Halo customer so you have the promise of a 4G mini box to always keep you connected even when your broadband is down. Yeah, right! I am a Halo customer and I had a mini box but it didn't work. After the customary 2 hours on the 'phone I was advised that the mini box I had was no longer supported and that I'd need a new one. Ah, said the handler, you're not a Halo customer so can't have one. I thought I was but for some reason my account showed I didn't even have broadband! I was exhausted at this stage having been on the line for almost 2 hours 45 minutes but next day got renewed energy and entered the fray once more. It was eventually accepted that I should have had a mini box and one was sent out, arriving the next day but, of course, it didn't work. Back on the 'phone watching another 2 hours of my life drain away. The some good news, the mini box works and my broadband will be connected in another 5 days; 10 days late but progress. After 5 days and hearing nothing I began to suspect all was not going to plan (surprise!) so decided to check the order status on my account. Imagine my surprise when the order stated that broadband was going to be connected to the house I'd just sold!!. So, off to good old 0800 800150 to listen to the calming Scottish tones telling me that BT are sorry for the delay. After 45 minutes I get through to the 'Home Moving Team' who I'm almost on first name terms with and I'm told that the whole order has been done incorrectly and will have to be done again. The nice lady tells me it is now fixed and I'll get my broadband on the 15th March some 3 weeks later than promised. We'll see but honestly, I'm past caring. The plus side of my experience is that each individual BT employee has been helpful and polite even if the promised help has subsequently not appeared. It is clear that there is a major process failure which, judging from the other reviews, BT either can't or can't be bothered to address. The decision to route everyone through one number which takes an age to be answered and then requires the caller to be transferred to wait another age may be great for BT but the customer expereince is is appalling.",JP,2021,3,7,1,0.065,0.133,Positive

Doesn’t even deserve one star,"Doesn’t even deserve one star! So I signed up for BT on the 6th of January didn’t hear anything from Bt after so I had to get back in touch and order again on the 25th of January. My hub arrived pretty quickly to be fair but this was literally the only quick and efficient part. Opened the box and half of the connections were missing, there was no adsl filter or grey connection cable. So I waited for a couple of days and still herd nothing from BT so I made a call to find out when I would be connected. They told me I would go live on the 5th of February, this date came and went so I had to contact BT again, they then said I would be live on the 12th of feb, which was fine. The 12th came and still no connection, so of course I called BT again, they told me they needed to get an engineer out and that one would come on the 15th, yes you know what’s coming next, still no broadband or engineer. I had to make yet another call to Bt to then be told that an engineer would be out to get the connection up and running etc on the 4th of March and I would be live between the 4th-6th, yet again still no connection so I had to make another phone call yet again today! To my frustration I was told the same bulls*it and that they would speak to the connections team so I was told she would one be a few short moments.....55mins I was on hold for to then be cut off. So yes at this point I’m done, someone was good enough to call me back and apologise for the loss of connection and said they just needed to go through some security questions with me before he could look into it, I stopped him at this point and told him to cancel my order, he said again he was sorry on behalf of Bt and will get this sorted rite away, I said cancel my order and have gone with a different provider now, sky promise I will be live on the 16th of March. Music to my ears, my children mite finally be able to connect to the internet and do their schoolwork log onto google classroom and try and somewhat catch up with the work they have not been able to do thanks to BT.

Appalling! I will never ever go with Bt again after this experience, I will avoid at ALL costs, certainly will not be recommending BT to anyone ever. Also when you call customer services expect to be on the phone for atleast two hours, you will spend around 110mins listening to music on hold while they go and make a cup of tea and eat cake, to pop on the phone for about a min to tell you it will be connected at such and such a date then hang up, and guess what......you don’t get connected.

Dreadful service,"Dreadful service It all started with my installation being cancelled 3 times , when they did arrive the engineer's were a credit to themselves ( no fault pointed at them what so ever).Once installation was completed they could not get it to work and spent a few hours to try and resolve to no avail , returned the next day to try again and still no resolution .Engineers have passed it back and BT who do not have an estimate of when it can be resolved.Canceling installation and staying with existing provider what an embarrassment of a business wish I could leave no stars",Wayne Beal,2021,3,5,1,0.182,0.07,Negative
Questionable business practices,"If you enjoy feeling powerless and without any rights to demand better of your service then BT are the perfect provider for you. As always with these companies, you're forced into uneccassarily long contracts (24 months) and the advisors you conduct buisness with are extremely crafty, casually forming a verbal contract in disguise as friendly conversation. They slip in the small print and minutae of contract in a way that undermines it and makes the terms of your contract not explicitly clear. Now, fast forward down the line when you inevitably call about a problem (24 months is after all a very long time) they become very shrewd and start coldly quoting contracts and agreements that you apparently made years ago over the phone leaving you with absolutely no bargaining chips. They can essentially do what they like and you have no right to seek better service elsewhere or they'll hit you with a massive cancellation fee.I argued against the fee for weeks, speaking to managers and expressing my disappointment that I should be penalised for wanting to leave when the whole situation arose in the first place from lackluster service on their part. They keep up a false pretense of friendliness but the whole time its abundantly clear they have no intention of backtracking or compromising and that a big company such as them are still going to take an extortionate amount of money from the pocket of a working person.In what way is over £200 a justifiable cost for them stopping a broadband and TV service? How much does it actually cost them to turn on a line? Its purely bullying tactics to force people into remaining loyal rather than inspiring loyalty through good service.",TheAidanBs,2021,3,5,1,0.109,0.112,Positive

Very crafty and not to be trusted,"We were told that our line rental was £45. Although others in the same area were paying £10. This made our additional monthly charge of £95. For landline, viewbox and “the fastest broadband in the area” - it isn’t but that’s what they said.(so must be true) Average ping is 50-70 in the day and 30-40 ping at night. We were repeatedly told that they couldn’t lower our line rental although they finally did after an hour and a half phone explaining that those on the Same street paid lower. We finally got the price of line rental down to  £25. Still high for the area. They are very crafty. And insisted they couldn’t lower the price but did after explaining how high it was.

BT can not handle address changes.

Makes no sense does it? well, if you liked that - stay tuned there's more to come.Second - i was moving house, i gave them the new address and everything was put into motion. it was confirmed that the engineer would arrive at my new address on the monday and that the equipment would arrive the Thursday/Friday prior. Now, you're thinking ""what could go wrong here?"" well, they sent the engineer to the correct address, yes. but guess what! they sent the equipment to my old address!! which was rejected by the new house owners and then i had to collect from the sorting office on the saturday (just in time for the engineer to arrive on the Monday) laughable that isnt it? handling a home move, installing the new equipment into my new address but sending it to my old address? Laughable.THIRD!! - it turned out that i couldnt have BT installed in my new address so the contract i had with BT was no longer valid (i think this is called a ""forced downgrade"") so obviously i had to cancel it and find a new provider. Now, there was a credit on my account - nothing massive just over £30. i contacted them to issue the refund. they confirmed they would via cheque AND THEY CONFIRMED TO ME THAT THEY WOULD SEND THE CHEQUE TO MY NEW ADDRESS - guess what? they sent the cheque to my old address!!! its laughable, it really is.",Kyle,2021,3,3,1,0.07,0.057,Negative

Cancelled our rolling contract against our wishes and forcing us into a 24-month contract,"Would leave them a 0-star if I could. Absolutely digusted.Completed our 24-month term with BT ~5 months ago and have been on a rolling contract since. Paying an additional £8/month for flexibility as we are in the process of moving home. We were due to move on the 1st March and in an attempt to be organised we arranged cancellation of our service with BT ~3 weeks in advance. Unfortunately, a problem has come up with our move, 6 days prior to the move we phoned BT to stop the cancellation of our service. They told us that was fine and they apologised for the delay with our move.Come the planned moving day they've cancelled our Broadband (but conveniently kept our phone line going) and are requiring us to sign up for a 24-month contract to re-instate our Broadband. They are refusing to re-instate our previous rolling contract despite cancelling against our wishes. We are being forced into signing a new contract. We don't know when we are moving now and are under an enormous amount of stress already. We are both working from home and need Broadband. But there is no way we should be able to be forced into signing a new contract when our previous arrangement was terminated against our wishes.We planned to move to Virgin at the new address because the BT speeds were less than 1/10th of Virgins and we didn't want a landline.

If I could give this company 0 stars,"If I could give this company 0 stars, I would. This is the worst provider I have ever been with and if I am being honest I don’t know where to start. Since moving house back in June 2020 we have changed our provider. We changed from sky (who is excellent) to these scammers. We pay £50 a month for resetting the router every 5 minutes and relying on our mobile data. With the deal we bought (which is pricey anyway!) we were ‘promised’ internet speed of 50 mbps, on a regular basis we are working with 30. This is not enough to watch a full episode on Netflix without it buffering or equally we have to wait 10 minutes to get onto a website. Being in a household with an a level student who has relied on online learning for the past year has been incredibly frustrating for her and in some cases has had to miss whole lessons until the internet is ‘fixed.’ The real funny part to all of this is when we check our speed and see it’s under the required mbps, BT sh** themselves and all of a sudden our internet works... but only for 20 minutes or so. To top this all off nicely they have disconnected our phone line, meaning we are unable to get in contact with people and vice versa.

Instead of correcting the insensitive mistake, they dismissed it as a typo and said they'd reached what they'd called a deadlock. A deadlock usually has 2 sides to it but they decided they reached a deadlock because they couldn't just apologise and compensate me for lost time, and referred me to the ombudsman. I have actually worked in BT billing dept, so I know how a bereavement should be processed on the system and someone at BT didn't do their job properly, but as usual, the customer is inconvenienced and met with an abhorrent, uncaring attitude.

Terrible Service,"awful service, they have way of never being able to deal with a complaint fully, so you end up being passed around from one dept. to another - clearly this is a strategy to avoid conflict as the advisor can effectively say 'that's not my job' and then the customer eventually gives up.

I have to say 9/10 were useless, i had one lady who was really trying to help me but couldnt do it neither.I have written formal complaints, i stopped paying, nobody in this organisation can resolve this. I would highly recommend NOT to sign with BT, once you have an issue it takes 30-40m to reach customer service who are useless.

Buyer Beware If Purchasing From BT,"I have recently cancelled my contract with BT and switched to Zen.  My new supplier made the arrangements for the transition.  Almost immediately they made the request to BT I received an email from them.  The Best way to describe the communication was words of doom and gloom would befall me due to me switching supplier some would say almost threatening.My new contract commenced from today, BT switched off their services at 0017 last night.  It felt like like BT were acting like a spoilt child and switching off the service at an out of hours time so as to cause as much disruption to me as possible.  I believe a responsible caring Company would aid in the transition to ensure that if my new supplier didn't deliver I would return to them.Further, they have sent an email with regards to them doing their bit for the environment and to return the equipment they provided.  It's not a request saying ""if you cannot dispose of this equipment responsibly then you can return it"" its an instruction to return it!  I thought I would seek clarity by going on their so called online help, this is equally confusing. They provide clear instruction if you purchased your contract post 2019 but totally no guidance if your contract commenced prior to this date. In fact, for some it will give the impression that if you don't  return the items you are going to be charged for this whether your contract before or after 2019.But what has really annoyed me is that they asked if I would answer some questions which led on to provide any further information.  As always, I look to be honest and sincere when completing these reviews so as  to provide feedback for any supplier to improve.  However after spending nearly 30 minutes providing feedback I press ""Next"" only to be thrown out as I hadn't put a title and unable to go back without writing the entire monologue again.It is clearly evident from the reviewers who have contributed to Trustpilot BT are one of the worse suppliers on the market place.

This is despite me stating that unless it would be working fully by 3rd Feb 2021 (about 6 weeks from ordering, giving allowance for a Covid challenges) I would not sign up with them. They absolutely assured me this would be done. Instead, it has been an endless series of cockups. They blame OPENREACH. And OPENREACH blame them.

However the installation is a mess. There is a large diameter pipe sticking up from the pavement, with a tiny fibre optic cable sticking out of it, and can easily be tripped on by people who walk along the pavement. They have drilled through my wall which has blown a large piece of concrete rendering out and they just smeared some transparent mastic over it.

There is absolutely nothing to recommend this company. They are the epitome of that most dangerous of entities, a private sector monopoly.

BT - Bad phone connection and unreliable Broadband connection,"BT phone line terrible:  static, line breaks up so that neither party can hear what the other is saying.  Broadband connection is unreliable, and more frequently than not, I have to connect manually.  BT-S6AFST:  ""Properties"" states CONNECT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IN RANGE!  Assume from this, that most of the time, I am not in range which is why I have to connect to the Broadband manually.  However, I find that often, but not always, during off peak hours, I AM CONNECTED AUTOMATICALLY.   Two BT Openreach engineers have visited, the second took my jack apart, and advised that there were no internal problems.  Now, BT is saying that the issues are internal.  Suggested that I use another telephone to see if the line is any better.  Telephones are expensive items to buy!  Just how far will BT go to avoid taking responsibility for such inadequate service - buy another phone and plug it in and see if it works - now, come on!  BT is dreadful, customer service non existent, and a very bullying attitude is adopted when the problem is escalated to the Communications Ombudsman.  And, I am paying them high £s for this poor service.

We asked to be re-connected but they have said this would take a week, leaving us unable to work at home. No solutions have been given, other that for us to go and by a network dongle, which will not work well as we don't have adequate reception where we are and won't meet our needs.

No I wasn’t having that firstly I’d paid for an engineer secondly I’m useless at things like that I said he would have to come and set up  there was no way I could do it myself. He got onto his manager who cleared for him to thankfully enter our house we were asked to obviously stay away out the room and open windows for ventilation. Of course I complied due to the covid risk. My engineer shah was very pleasant friendly he talked it through with me when he was setting it up I now have better internet but can’t get it through the tv at moment I’m sure we will once it’s settled ? and we have to change codes etc with our cctv but someone’s coming out today to sort.

I was a little sharp with the engineer on the telephone when he said he couldn’t enter property but all was sorted only took 10 minutes lovely chap credit to the company,Linda Louise,2021,2,16,5,0.059,0.154,Positive

I have to start off this review by…,"I have to start off this review by stating that having (or attempting) to have Fibre to home installed by BT is by far the worst experience I have had with any company for any product in my life. I can not explain in words how angry I am at BT.This all started on the 21st of November 2020 when we decided to have the new Fibre to Premises installed due to us averaging 16mb connection and with a small family it wasn’t good enough, as soon as two devices were connected everything ground to a halt. We were given a installation date of the 21st of December which was a bit longer than expected but I though a month would go by quickly. I booked the day off and as this date approached I logged onto the “Order tracker” to make sure everything was ok. I was shocked to see that the date had been moved another month later to the 21st of January. I made contact with BT after waiting for about an hour to get through. I was told that the first date was only an estimation and the new date was the contractual date. I was told that if it wasn’t installed on that date then I would be receiving £5 a day until it was installed. I wasn’t happy at this but I was glad I had a guaranteed date (or so I thought) No one had contacted me and no one had explained this. I was again off work on the 21st and I waited in for my appointment, and waited and waited until it started to go dark. I assumed by that point that they wouldn’t be coming. I then could look forward to another hour waiting to speak with BT. When I eventually managed to speak with them they apologised and said that the engineers had just ran out of time. Due to how much I had been messed about after speaking with Openreach they gave me an expedited appointment of the 27th of January. Can anyone guess what happened on the 27th of January? That’s right no one turned up and no one made any contact with me. Luckily I had the hours wait to speak with BT about this. (maybe there not that busy at the call centres but their service is that bad they give customers a “cooling off period” so they can calm down)My latest date to take off from work was the 15th of February I was given a morning slot of 0800 – 1300hrs and assured my work was on as “high priority” 8am, 9am, 10am 11am, 12pm 1pm all came and went. We then received a phone call from the engineer saying he was running late but asked if it was ok to come at 3pm. Not Idea but we were finally getting installed we would be up and running by the evening (or so we thought) When the engineer arrived he was very nice but said that we wouldn’t be online today as they only had on their sheet “external fit” and wouldn’t be coming in the house. I challenged this and explained about all the history. He said “they can only do internal fit if you have below 30mb” I explained that we were well below that at 16mb. To which he replied “you cant be, its probably your wifi” By this point I was loosing the will to live. So I thought id cheer myself up with a 45minute wait to speak with BT, I didn’t realise how lucky I was going to be because I had the pleasure of two 45minute waits due to them cutting me off when the questions got to hard. At the time of writing this I have been given a new installation date ……20th of April !!!!! So due to BTs own compensation scheme I am now owed £75 in missed appointments £445 in days compensation. Whats the chances of that ??On a brighter note by the time I update this story we should all be out of lockdown and getting on with some kind of life. Thanks for reading, remember if you don’t like paying your BT bill, just ask for fibre to premises to be installed, they will never turn up to fit it and your bill will be paid by the compensation.",Bobby ,2021,2,16,1,0.046,0.097,Positive
Great Customer Service from BT,"My BT Full Fibre got off to a poor start with significant delays with installation due to incompetence from Openreach.

Total mess,"Despite reservations after my debacle with them and BTSport I was desperate to get away from TalkTalk broadband as their service of late has been shocking. Big mistake! After eventually filling lots of information to get BT broadband I find I can’t see my new account, it only logs me in to the old Sports pass account (which they should have closed by now). Then after 9 days have went by and still no email confirmation of my order or any contact whatsoever, I decide to contact them. First number called, automated message “20-30 minute queue”! So tried raising a complaint online, can’t you need an account (mine had failed). Okay let’s chat, can’t no operators available!! Right let’s just write an old fashioned letter – 28 days to get a reply!!! Back to calling them on their complaint number this time – “10-20 minute queue” so I was told – no, took over 25 minutes. Was on the phone to some guy in Falkirk who sounded sick as a chip, so I did not really give him a bad time. Took this old guy 3-4 attempts to find the order, probably something to do with my account set-up failure as he said “for some reason the account is still shown as pending”. Reason being their IT is rubbish. So the nice guy cancelled my order and told me I would get an email confirmation immediately.

I ordered internet and a landline via…,I ordered internet and a landline via the BT website.  They called me to confirm and assured me that the boxes would be delivered on the 4th Feb and go live on the 5th.  These two dates came and went with no sign of anything.  When I called on the 7th they claimed they had no record of the transaction.  The next best they could do was the 19th Feb.  When we asked if we could be moved up the queue because of them losing our order the advice was to not complain otherwise Openreach might move our instillation date even further into the future.  So I am now stuck in a home with a pregnant wife trying to work and no one at BT appears to care or feels inclined to take responsibility for their mistakes.  The knock on effect of this is that I am basically without comms (v weak mobile signal) when I am at home with a wife who is 9 months pregnant. All BT seem to be able to say is it Openreach's fault or computer says no.  Your staff on the phone try but they are let down by a company that does not care.,Ben ,2021,2,12,1,0.066,0.069,Positive

I was past around people and departments and nobody could help me.  After 2 weeks without service I was told an engineer was coming out at the beginning of the week.   They didnt turn up.  I was AGAIN sent round the houses and left on hold for 45 minutes.  I was told the visit had been rebooked for this coming Monday but a manager would ring me.  The manager did not ring me until today.  I was then told an engineer will not be coming to me this Monday either because the process for booking had failed AGAIN and they cannot tell me why or when an engineer will come out.  Meanwhile I cannot operate my business.  I have lost revenue and reputation with my multinational clients.  BT seems to be a big business who couldnt care less about small businesses.  Infuriating, disappointing, upsetting.  Just to make it worse, I received marketing materials from them today telling me all I need to do was to call them to get online immediately.

Worst customer service and worst fibre broadband,"Worst customer service and worst broadband I’ve ever had.We complaint several times about the low speed and frozen connection constantly happening. After “doing their checks” we were told that the issue was the cables reaching the property and they couldn’t do anything about it, therefore they strongly recommended to change to fibreoptic for any improvement (and just £5 more a month).Such a disappointment when we did go for the fibreoptic broadband and it still doesn’t work ir if it does the speed is ridiculous slow. I obviously made a complaint, through their website in this case, as trying to call customer services is impossible (I can’t be waiting for an hour for an agent to attend the call). An agent texted me twice to say she was going to call me in the next 5 minutes, which she never did. The third time she texted me and actually called, I was at work and couldn’t pick up (yes, because some people work and cannot talk during their shifts, contrary to what BT might think). Finally, she sent an email explaining that my case was closed, as she had tried to contact to me for further information and couldn’t reach me (she tried just once! And it wasn’t even an arranged call, so good luck with that). Conclusion, I’m still paying a higher price than I was, to get the slowest fibre broadband I’ve ever had in my life and being unable to contact the customer service appropriately.Unacceptable service and shameless behaviour from the customer service. I will definetely change provider as soon as I can.",Maria,2021,2,12,1,0.084,0.06,Negative
CHANGED OUR NUMBER!!!,"Decided to switch from Sky to BT for FTTP as our broadband was appallingly slow. We have switched in the past on a number of occasions. Came to connect this morning. Everything fine... or so we thought! Speed of bb is excellent. Can't fault it. However, we now have an issue with our landline discovered this afternoon after trying to ring our landline number from our mobiles. Rang BT and spoke to a very helpful operative who informed me that they have actually changed our number (after using it for 38 years) without even informing us!!! She also informed me that there was no actual paperwork on my account to confirm this change of number! Hence our ignorance of the situation. I  assured her that if we had had this information, I most certainly would have complained there and then to them. I am hoping that this issue will be resolved on Tuesday, when the operative has promised to ring me back with progress of trying to regain my old number. I have never had any issues with any of the other switches and hope, most sincerely, that this is resolved ASAP. Meanwhile we have a temporary number that no one is aware of and don't want to think of thesituation we find ourselves in if the original number cannot be used.

Their customer service was so poor that I cancelled my contact with them straight away. The contrast in service between TalkTalk and BT is quite astounding. When I phone BT I have been able to get through to someone straight away and I have each person I spoke to very professional and helpful. There was a minor hiccup when my broadband didn’t start working on the stated go live date, but this was resolved with one phone call to BT who arranged for an engineer to fix the problem a few days later, and in the meantime they sent me a complimentary mobile router to use while it was being fixed.

The worst company to deal with,"The worst company to deal with.  An absolute joke.  They were unable to get me a line connected for 4 months but charged me via direct debit for the service I never had.  I waited for them to install the line 3 times. They canceled install without letting me know twice.  The first time they didn't do a site survey and tried to blame me for not being ready for the install as they didn't have the correct equipment to isntall.  Then said the service they offered me wasn't even available.  I have spent hours on the phone to them trying to get my money back.  Then they sent me a cheque that I cant pay into my internet account!  So they want me to set up a direct debit again so they can refund the money.  I don't want to do this as a few days ago I got an email stating my ""latest bill"" was ready and I am sure they will take more money for a service I don't have.  I get nowhere with the calls, just sent to different departments.  Online chat are frustrating.  NEVER, EVER GO WITH BT.So - UPDATE.  I have never had a line put in as they didn't quite manage that!  I have just had an overdue payment letter!  can you believe it.  So now I'll have to sort this out or no doubt it will go to claims and mess up my credit score.

Misleading contract information. Avoid at all cost,"When I signed my BT landline plus broadband contract, I was informed it is going to be a 12-month contract. One month before the contract ends, I phoned customer service to give the 30 days notice. I was told that my contract has magically extended. I have to pay £140++ worth of cancellation fee. This is all be cause BT sneakily advertised the landline service to be mis-matched with the broadband, so that we customers will be tricked to pay for the broadband for 18 months.

The internet then became incredibly slow and began to turn off throughout the day. I contacted BT again and they said an engineer would come out in 5 days time as there was now a supposed fault(which was fine before).

Every call takes between an hour and 2 hours because I have to call the 150 number - to be put thru to connections... who have to contact “connections chase team” who have to contact Open Reach” who are only contactable by email!! It’s a joke - Also, when we moved in we had a gap between houses in an Airbnb because of this they charged us £550 for breaking our 2 year contract early and as we couldn’t transfer it immediately to our new home!! I’d broken my contract!!! They were contacted to connect me when we did move in but because connection was only an estimated date I’m not entitled to their £5 a day compensation. This company are disgusting - as you can probably tell by my rant I’m soooo furious..... and losing the will!!!!!  Just how bad can they be before someone does something.

WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!,"I wish I had read these reviews before deciding to move to BT. They assured me transferring over to them would cause minimal disruption. Instead, I have had to be home on 3 separate occasions for installation. Instead, they’ve managed to cut off my existing Sky internet and phone line and it still isn’t back on. I am now being told that it will be next week until they can send an engineer out to my house (originally it was 8th MARCH!!! Until I argued with them!). My wife and I can’t work from home (I am having to go into work and I am clinically vulnerable) , kids can’t be homeschooled, we can’t access any TV services such as Netflix or Amazon and my parents can’t call us (they only use landline not mobile phones). THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE. The most annoying thing is each customer representative tells you something different and they never call you back after promising to do so. I’ve spent over 1 hour on hold each time I have called them (always busy surprise surprise), eating further into my family team on an evening and making me increasingly frustrated.

Go with anyone else. BT are useless.,"TL;DR: BT disconnected our broadband 9 days ago assuring us it'd be reconnected by the end of the day, 9 days later we have a different home phone number that we didn't ask for, 6 months extended on our contract that we didn't ask for, 20+ hours wasted on the phone, and we still have no broadband and absolutely no idea when we will have it back.My older brother had to move home over December and noticed that his BT contract, which had 18 months remaining on it, was £25 a month cheaper than our parents. So since he'd have to pay it anyway, and my parents had exceeded their contract, he suggested that my parents cancel their contract and we use his instead, which was exactly the same in every way in terms of the speed of the internet, except it was just cheaper.On the 19th January my brother called BT, was confirmed by my dad to be able to speak on his account and confirmed that my father was able to talk on his account, and was assured by BT that everything would be sorted by the 28th. The 28th came, our broadband was disconnected early in the morning and we realised that they had also changed our home phone number even with our express request to keep the original number, which meant that my 85 year old recently widowed grandmother who has also recently broken her wrist was unable to contact us. We also have no idea who else might be trying to call us because their call forwarding is not working, as we have tried to call our old number on our mobiles to no avail.My brother also noticed that his contract had been renewed by a further 6 months back to the original 24 months, which he definitely didn't ask for because he wanted to use up his contact from his old apartment.By the end of the 29th my dad and brother must have spent 8 hours total on the phone to BT trying to get our phone number back as well as trying to get our broadband reconnected, all this while my dad was unable to do his work as he is currently working from home. At this point they had both needed to reconfirm each other to be allowed to speak on the others account twice more each, since they kept getting the usual ""We can't speak to you, is your father/son there for us to speak to them as it is his account."" After several hours we found out that apparently Openreach weren't scheduled to reconnect our broadband until the 2nd of February, the first we had heard of it, but in the meantime they said they'll send us a 4g router to make up for the lack of broadband. The 4g router provides around 2mb/s speeds if we're lucky, and it has no ethernet ports so we can't connect anything that relies on direct connection. My brother's contract is supposed to have 70mb/s speeds.At this point I had missed a university deadline due to the lack of internet, my dad had been unable to work from home, my brother has been unable to do his online computer security course, and my mother, who is a GP and an essential worker in the NHS, is also unable to take patient calls from home should the need arise.The 2nd of Feb came and passed with still no broadband. On the 3rd my brother called them up again and they essentially said ""whoopsie, we meant they're connecting your broadband on the 3rd."" So we had to wait till the end of that day, and still had no broadband.By this point BT have stopped even giving us any estimates of when we'd be reconnected, and every time my brother or father called them up they have to start from square one of explaining what is happening, to then be told ""we'll call you back between 2-5pm"" and then we get no call back. My brother has reported them to Ofcom, but he said Ofcom told him that we need to be without broadband for *8 weeks* before they can do anything about it. That's 2 months! What the hell!? Lockdown might be over by then!We're considering going with Sky, but we don't know if they'd be any better, plus we don't even know if we're going to get our original phone number back, which we've had for 20+ years.

That's nearly twice the price, for a 2-year fixed-length contract, meaning an extra £460+ over the 2 years.

Hopeless,"I can’t decide whether BT customer service simply lie to you or are just totally inept. However, based on my experience that people rarely go to work with the intention of doing a bad job, let’s be charitable and go with the latter. Every dealing with BT over the past year (whether it be an order for goods or a change of telephone/broadband package) has been problematic. Whatever they tell you is never true, they don’t do what they say they’ll do and their sole motive is to get your enquiries off their desk as quickly as possible with minimal effort on their part. Currently in the midst of trying to sort out a Direct Debit that hasn’t worked since changing package (4 month ago) and despite numerous calls, “chats”, a registered complaint (that they keep closing despite remaining unresolved), blatant misinformation from BT and misrepresentation of my situation on their totally hopeless online system still shows no sign of getting resolved. As soon as the industry opens up to allowing people to retain their email address when switching providers, I’ll be saying good riddance to BT - after over 30 years as a customer. It’s only the thought of having to change email address that stops me leaving today - and they know it... hence their attitude and lip service to customer care.

Even now, in Feb 2021, the BT Sport website suggests it is ok to watch its programmes anywhere in the EU.Also, I have a VPN, but it does not work, BT detects it so I am unable to connect using that method.It seems impossible to contact BT directly to ask why this is an issue and you could hang on the phone listening to an automated message for hours before being fobbed off, and there is no email to contact, or just quit and cancel your card payments and get on with your life. I know I will not ever connect with anybody in order to receive a refund so here is a warning for any potential customer who thinks that BT is a good idea. Ever since I can remember BT customer support has been appalling and it still is. Please avoid the BT Rip Off at all costs and instead choose NOW TV or a similar provider. Good luck!",Steve Cole,2021,2,2,1,0.059,0.088,Positive
Beware before you sign up,"So far I’ve had to make 6 phone calls, each lasting 30 mins since Saturday 30th Jan to try and resolve an issue with internet and phone line dropping off many times. Eventually told that an engineer from Openreach would visit today (Feb 2nd) between 8am and 1pm to resolve issue. Unfortunately they didn’t turn up or contact me so then made another 30 min phone call to be told water damaged cables had been replaced and issue was resolved, so case was closed.Less than 1 hour later, internet failed again, then later in evening, same again.Made yet another phone call to be told that case had been re opened and someone from Openreach would contact me tomorrow. I’ve absolutely no faith in them at all, only time will tellGotta be one of the worst companies I’ve ever dealt with.

Money for very old rope,"It's this kind of frustration that makes life so needlessly difficult. A multi billion pound company cannot fix a fault on an old person's landline. It seems to be a step too far. It doesnt involve TAKING money, which the company is highly efficient at doing, as you would expect of a multi billion pound company. Now lets see if it can expend a micro fraction of these huge profits on maintaining its equipment for the benefit of someone else.. someone who pays monthly on the nose for the very occasional use of that equipment. No, that side of the deal has not been developed yet.Cant communicate, or complain, online without logging in. Cant log in without having a BT account number. The fault is on my mother's line. She doesnt have internet. So I have to go through the phone to get this resolved. A BT engineer allegedly fixed the fault 6 days after being reported. Note: 6 days. How does it take a multi billion pound company 6 days to send someone to fix their equipment? How is that even allowed? And it's not fixed. BT has no way of verifying whether he actually attended the site or not, so the adviser says. Another attempt waiting for an engineer to go out or not go out, as he chooses. Hopefully this time, i will be notified on the text. But no guarantees as, last time, the texts dried up and the fault was left 'open'.BT, you should be ashamed of yourselves providing this sort of service to old people who are struggling to pay your rent for something that's broken and looks like it's going to remain broken until you decide that, really, you ought to perform your side of the contract. I dont suppose my old mother will get a rent refund either.",A. Burgess,2021,2,2,1,0.089,0.088,Negative

Slimy Slippery BT,"Slippery, slimy company. Every other month almost for my whole contract they would take an additional £10+ and I would have to get it taken off next month's bill with no explanation required as to why it was added on. Due to this when renewing my contract I requested they send out the paperwork covering the whole contract so every time I called up I didn't have to argue and could prove my case. They sent out the paperwork as requested, however within 5 months of the new contract they increased the direct debit amount and explained that this was notified in an email that gave me 4 weeks to cancel my contract if I wasn't happy with the new charges, I did not see this email before it was too late, as they expect most people would therefore trapping them within the contract for another 19 months with no option to get out at their increased rate. I explained regardless of the email they have to obey the terms of the contract we signed for 24 months (The contract did NOT mention the yearly price increase as stated in the email they sent a month before incurring it) therefore they CANNOT legally increase the direct debit amount as they have breached the terms they provided within their contract). For this reason, I was well within my rights to cancel the contract, cut off the direct debit payment and immediately select a new supplier (which I did) as they were refusing to drop the price back down to its original contracted amount.... To this date, they continue to pursue me with cancellation charges of over £250+ and even had the cheek to ask me to send their router back, no chance...... Listen BT, when you break your own terms of your contract and refuse to negotiate and resolve your price increase which was NOT stated within the contract DO NOT expect educated people such as myself to continue paying your illegal fees when we are highly aware and know the extent of what you can and CAN'T get away with.... Also, bare in mind for the £10 extra they took every other month a lot of my friends also had the same issue and didn't call through to reclaim it. Now if they did that to all their customers and they had 2,000,000 million customers and only 50% noticed and reclaimed it back then they have just inherited a free bonus of £10,000,000....This is where we need to pay attention and stop these big corporate companies from slipping through the net, it's a small price to pay for a customer but a huge few years off for the fat cats to spend on their yachts, be aware people. You can actually catch their yearly price increase in the small terms and conditions on their new advert on TV, a shame they didn't include it in the paper contract I signed last year, this wouldn't have been needed. In better news, I moved onto Vodafone who supplied me with a ""Fixed Fee Contract"" (Obviously aware of these slippery companies) with a higher Mbps and at a cheaper rate with a FREE Apple TV box with 1 years FREE Subscription, over the moon!

BT is a dinosaur!,"I live in the country and BT can only offer me max 3MB broadband speed (it is usually about 1MB) so I had a mobile BB mast installed (Astra BB Group) which gives me over 40MB speed (actually measured 52MB this morning).

Then today on chat with BT for over 30 minutes to discover it is impossible for a customer to view end of contract details on the BT website and that furthermore I had to speak with someone to ensure the transfer request to the new provider was cancelled. That filled me with dread given yesterday’s experience.

Guess what the plan was never cancelled and they are still taking my money for two PLANS!!!! I have made numerous calls put in complaints and asked for a manager to call but again guess what nothing has been done. I see this as theft by taking money for two phone and broadband plans. To top it all off after my last complaint they have now cut off my phone line and still haven't reinstated it. I run a business and am losing thousands of pounds worth of business everyday as i don't have a phone line.

The customer is actually paying for a BT representative merely to open the cardboard box containing the modem, plug it in and check that the line is working which is something that any idiot could do... My flat requires a new double socket for the broadband service which I thought would be fitted today between 12 and 2.Shortly after 12 my landline rang and a young woman indicated that she would be talking me through the installation over the phone due to Covid. I thought this very strange as my knowledge of Telecoms socket installation is non existent. No suggestion that if this occurred my £30 paid for a visit would be refunded.  When she asked if this was OK I stated that it was not. I was expecting an engineer. She then said that she was the person attending, was 5 minutes away and so would be with me shortly.  I had moved the furniture away from the main socket for the engineer to have easier access and so was rather startled when the young woman arrived on my door stop without any bag or equipment and proceeded to just plug in the modem.She then told me that Openreach install the sockets but are not doing this at the moment due to the pandemic. I was stunned that I had been charged £30 by BT for someone just to plug in the modem. On the online form BT are 'shy' about saying exactly what the 'home tech expert' will do. BT should make it clear that these experts are not providing any technical service whatsoever. A subsequent BT email suggested that the 'expert' would tell me how to make the most of my new service and share some handy tips and tricks when they arise. No such tips or tricks were proffered.It is just scandalous. I am thinking of setting up a new business opening cardboard boxes and just plugging cables into electric sockets at £30 a pop. What a great wheeze!PS BT have now refunded the £30 fee. The documentation provided by them initially made various references to an 'engineer' which was confusing.",Sue Tuck,2021,1,21,1,0.071,0.041,Negative

The single worst customer experience I have ever had,"It appears from the last 2 hours worth of conversations with BT personnel that nobody has any idea what they are doing. This all started when our internet connection was turned off randomly due to there being a breakdown in communications between openreach and BT meaning our account was never fully set up (through no fault of me/the customer).Speaking with BT I was told initially that this could be sorted out the next day and that I would have to speak with the connections department at 8am the next day in order to get it pushed through. I raised a complaint about the way I had been treated up to that point. I was then transferred to the retentions team where I was told it could take up to 5 working days for the connection to come live again - completely contradicting what I had been told 5 minutes before (either one of them could be lying to me to stop me getting angry or just plain stupid - difficult to know which). Having been told this I tried to speak to management but was denied and instead transferred to a third department - clearly someone was trying to pass the buck. Upon getting through to this department I spoke to someone who actually understood customer relations and explained the situation. The entire series of events that lead to the internet being turned off was farcical: Dec 23rd - Internet activated and then 2 minutes later we missed an appointment (the BT engineer was there the entire day)Dec 24th - Electrician lays new cable to the flat and the internet is working Dec 25th - Apparently missed an appointment that was never booked (being Christmas Day nobody was working so this was clearly a lie from BT)Jan 20th - An entry was made saying the next available live date was Jan 12th (in the past) (clearly showing the incompetence of BTs employees)Jan 20th - Internet turned off.At no point during the month we were using the internet did anyone reach out to us to complete the set up or discuss anything in spite of them seeing usage on the account. Speaking to the advisor I found out my previous complaint had been closed for no reason - clearly trying to cover up their tracks and protect their SLAs. Needless to say, another complaint has been raised. I was advised to call back at 8am the next day so that we could get the connection live again. I rang back today at 8am to run through the process again, only to be hung up on. I have since been waiting on hold for 40 minutes to try and get back through to this same department. My advice would be to avoid BT at all costs. As the title says, this is the worst customer experience I have ever had. Their employees don't know what they are doing which leads to further frustration, heightened by the fact they were clearly lying throughout the process. Their customer service is hopeless.",Charles Butler,2021,1,21,1,0.123,0.038,Negative

Neither of them worked, called back again and eventually they told me that neither of them adapters would work with my router anyway and if I wanted to extend the connection it would be another £15 a mont taking my bill to nearly £60 a month. I asked BT what their justification was for charging so much money, the customer service agent answered “because we offer premium equipment and a premium service” I just laughed at her.Eventually when I could, I switched to TalkTalk which is like living a dream!

AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS,"If I could give BT a minus score then it would be minus 5. We've had BT broadband for over a year now and to say it's an absolutely terrible service is putting it lightly, living in a rural area I expected a slow connection before signing up with them and understood that the best we'd receive is 4mbs but when it works then it's a good signal...WHEN IT WORKS, we call BT ever week or every other weeks to try and get the service working and we have had 2 or more engineers out every month since taking the contract a year ago to try and sort the issues out and no matter what there is always a problem and if it's not with the line then it's a technical issue which can only supposedly be sorted by the so called tech experts back at BT (never gets sorted), we have had to now 4 complaints made to BT and all got cancelled after a day or 2 with no action being taken by BT, one of which was concerning inappropriate conduct towards my girlfriend by a BT engineer sent to investigate the problem at hand and after spending half hour on the phone to an operator explaining what happened a complaint was opened against the engineer and then closed 2 days later with no action being taken, we have had 3 engineer appointments made and then cancelled by the engineers on the day with no reasons given or notification and when called the BT operators checked the system and told us they will contact the engineers to find out the reasons why and then call us back...and low and behold no call back but the worse example of BT's total lack of customer care is that on Xmas Eve 2020 BT blocked our service as they decided that we wanted to change provider even after receiving a letter asking us if we had requested the change and being told we made no request and are staying with BT and it's nearly a month on and our service still hasn't been reconnected as we have to wait til the 26/01/2021. BT shows very little care or concern for the customers and never takes responsibility for their actions or terrible customer service and if we could choose another provider then we would do gladly but any issues will be passed onto BT to sort out. In short British Telecom has gone from being a trusted provider to being a a big company who thinks they can treat the customers like scum with no come back or penalties so I strongly recommend you do not have anything to do with BT.",Andy Ashburn,2021,1,20,1,0.116,0.085,Negative

Beware BT TV Packages,"Beware the new BT TV packages !The new packages are so complicated it will make your head hurt ! I signed up for a new contract via live chat & half of what I was told was told/promised was wrong !I was told the package I signed up for included HD, it didn't, that's an extra £5 a month, really, in this day & age !Previously I had Eurosport, this was the only channel I really didn't want to lose but now, in order to watch it via BT TV I had to sign up to Amazon Prime at £5.99 a month extra. Turns out, Eurosport is not included in AP, if you want it, it's an extra £6,99 a month ! Had I known that, I would not have signed up for AP & would have gone straight for Eurosport player which is only £4.99 a month & saved myself £7.99 & a load of grief !Having been signed up to stuff I didn't want in order to get stuff that wasn't included, I noticed that on their website there is a basic tv pack that......includes Eurosport all for £10 a month ! When I phoned to cancel the new package & sign up for the basic pack including Eurosport I was told it was not available !?When I phoned to enquire, I also discovered that I had been signed up for a new 2 year broadband contract too, which I had not asked for or been told that I was being signed up for !They sent an email saying my new monthly bill would be £50 a month, when I rang & spoke to the billing team I was told it would be £55 !

We moved home - superslow internet,"We moved home, we asked BT if we could take our superfast broadband with us, they said yes, they told us we would get about 55 mbps less than what we were supposed to get at our previous address, we agreed to that, they later denied this and we were told different speeds that we should get by different people, we were told 37 mbps by a manager, 36 mbps by a speed test staff member, 32 mbps by another BT employee and 22 mbps by yet another BT employee! makes you wonder where they get the responses they give from - do they pluck them out of the sky? We complained about the slow speed the BT employee said we were getting under 20 mbps he said he increased it to 37 mbps but that on our device we would probably get 34 mbps. Confused? What a mess!We complained a few times and said we wanted to leave, eventually we were told we could leave without any exit charges, we were told ""no more money would be taken from our account"" unless we had any calls to pay for, but the monthly charge was taken 2 days later, we then stopped our D/D and BT wrote to us telling us we needed to find another way to pay BT???? We complained and were told that we would owe BT for the period 21 - 29 January 2021, we will actually be leaving on 25 January 2021 if all goes to plan, my reply is below:If all goes to plan Virgin should be taking over our internet service on Monday 25 January, we were told there would be nothing more to pay unless there were any telephone call charges, we paid up front for all calls, you really need to communicate with each other and provide the correct information to customers. We will actually leave 5 days early. The latest message from you has made me more convinced that we made the right decision to leave BT as when we were told we could leave without any charge we were told that no more payments would be taken from our bank account, a few days later the D/D was taken for the month and now you are talking about yet more money. BT are the oldest telecommunications company in the UK and still they cannot provide a decent fast internet, but it is their customers who suffer, BT still charge the same high price for super-slow internet as they do for medium fast, what they call super-fast! The only stand alone company offer faster speeds.

Moving House Nightmare,"Just moved house due to unavoidable Covid related events and gave BT 21 days notice. On go live day in the new house, the broadband never started working. I live with a primary school key worker who hosts primary school lessons from home and have a meeting heavy job myself so had to get the issue resolved quickly. On the day after go live day and after raising the issue with BT at 7am, I was told that the broadband order had failed. I was not notified about this by BT previously. Then, after being on the phone with BT for an hour, I was told that a new order had to be placed in the system and I would have a go live date provided to me within 48 hours. That doesn’t mean that my broadband would be working within 48 hours but that I would simply be given a new date within 48 hours. I asked for the issue to be escalated and explained the situation to be told ‘that’s not how it works’. Right, maybe that’s not how it works at BT.I asked to speak to a manager and although I was told on the phone that I’d be contacted within 24 hours, I received a text saying that they would contact me 3 days later. I am, nevertheless, looking forward to that conversation.I am also a Halo subscriber so I pay for the BT ‘stay connected promise’. I was not given a 4G device by BT to stay connected so we had to rely on mobile phone data which was not sufficient. As such, a class of primary school kids missed their teacher for the day and I was not able to complete time sensitive tasks. Now, as a result, the same primary school teacher who is in a high risk covid category has to travel into central London tomorrow to teach her kids remotely. To add insult to injury, the reason that the original broadband order failed was because I am paying for full fibre broadband and am continuing with that deal due to my 18 month contract despite having fibre to cabinet only in the new property. I accept that as long as it works! So instead of establishing the connection and despite me having already had the lower internet speed communicated to me, BT decided to simply cancel the order because full fibre was not possible and not inform me of the cancelled order. Now lastly, as a final surreal cherry on top and nail in the coffin for me being a BT customer in future, I got an email from BT this evening telling me that I’m losing access to 5 of my favourite channels today but don’t worry because they are giving me an ‘exclusive offer’ of BT sport (which is already included in my contract) for £1 for the first month and £40 per month after that. I cannot understand if BT are wilfully trying to get rid of their customers or are really so utterly inept when it comes to customer service. Either way, I’m done with BT for good as soon as my expensive and lengthy contract expires. At a time when your customers rely so heavily on your services, you’re dropping the ball.

Because of the outstanding bill at this exceptional time, BT have cut off my phone and internet, although they call it a restriction, the lifeline now does not work and my children can't go to school.Their response to this was that I should pay the bill in full and begin another contract to keep the bill lower then I can have the internet back in a few hours. Other than that I could either stop their services and wait 30 days before I can find another provider or switch provider and wait 14 days before I can start with my new service.I have been a customer of theirs for years and always paid my bill.

Which was a cloud express wireless phone & broadband.I have BT broadband on my other business which i know how to set up. I set this up and the machine was flashing purple. So I called the BT express team in November. Who said they will resolve. I have been chasing this since November and no one has bothered to resolve this.They have sent a new modem out and the issue was not resolved.They sent a 4G reassure dongle and the issue wss still not resolved.They cannot tell me what the issue is as they keep suggesting its an issue from openreach.I called couple of weeks before my opening date of my business and they said the issue will get resolved ASAP! But im here on the 19th Jan 2021 and the issue has not been resolved.I am loosing money on a daily basis. Especially during this pandemic time where small business are struggling.

When promised that I would not be charged. I keep getting false promises from individuals in this company and they fail to fulfil them and then when you advise that you want to leave BT.

Trust Pilot should introduce negative stars,"I cannot stress how abysmal the recent customer service experience has been with each branch of BT. They forced upon up significant changes to the contract with TV channel swaps and supposedly upgrading the Smart Hub. Seemed OK at first glance.. but then the problems began. Subscription channels fell off a cliff, broadband connection became patchy to non-existent which forced our hand to contact the famously useless customer care team. I am up to 19 advisors and 8+ hours of phone calls to try & correct the issue that they forced upon us.. and am no closer to solving anything. I have resorted to cancelling everything to do with this aberration of a company in favour of the infinitely better value Sky package which has a ton more inclusions to boot - alongside a customer service team that picks up the phone promptly and seems to give a rats about you?! Strange that. I type this as I am on hold - again - trying to get the cancellations team to figure out how to cancel our services. 36hours later they are still struggling to grasp this concept. Not only that - they sent us an email citing fees of £1000 for the pleasure of giving them the boot! Funny that - there's me thinking not only did we have a cooling off period, but you have failed to provide any of the services outlined since our initial conversation. And as much as you enjoy emailing me to close the ongoing complaint each evening - it is still very much open, and litigation will be following. Anyone reading this, save yourself the time & anguish and jump across to Sky. BT's time is up.

"Back to their normal, great service","While not everything has been resolved (I still have paid for a service I did not have and could not use), I want to edit my review. After BT resumed their home visit service, I re-ordered my upgrade. The lady on the helpline was extremely helpful, and this time, the technician arrived in time and everything went without a hitch. So, hopefully, they are now back to their former, great service. I nonetheless leave my old review below, since these things happened, after all.For years, I was happy with BT - that's what the 2 stars are for. But during the last few months, they have gone from bad to worse. It started with MyBT not working, neither the website nor the app. For many weeks, I could not check my usage or manage my account/features.Then I cancelled a mobile phone contract. Cancellation was confirmed - but they did not cancel the contract, and so I had to do call them again, meaning I was bound a month longer than I should have.Then they deleted my BT email address because of inactivity. Which is okay. But I could not create a new address either, because they had me down as not entitled to one (wrong - I was and am, as broadband customer). They needed weeks and a complaint to get this sorted.But what happened now was the last straw. I upgraded my broadband, for more speed (working from home plus the kids home and online). This needs a visit by an engineer. I called their support and specifically asked whether they did this during lockdown. I was told yes. So I booked an appointment. It was confirmed. A day before, I was reminded of the appointment via email and text. The day came - but not coming was the engineer. I called their support and was assured the guy was still coming, only late. Yet no one appeared - and no one contacted me to cancel either. A day later they wrote on their website that they weren't doing any visits during lockdown. Well, then they should have closed their booking system and instruct their support accordingly! One of these things would be enough to consider switching. All four together would make even an ardent BT fan despair and seriously look for alternatives. Which is exactly what I will do now. I'd rather pay the penalties than stay with a company that can't get things sorted and treats long-term customers like that.",Ms.  Boettcher,2021,1,14,4,0.069,0.108,Positive

Look Elsewhere For Internet to Save Hassle,"Still have no broadband after my home move. This was meant to be connected from the 15/12. Over 3 hours on the phone since 19/12. Three separate engineers could not find the fault, customer service and technical support have not idea what the problem is. Engineers advised to order new hub as that might fix the issue. It did not and then BT send a letter advising if I do not return the hub (that I did not even want) I may be fined. Promised call backs that I have never received. Asked to make a complaint over the phone on two occasions but would not let me as issue 'ongoing'. Have submitted a written complaint but not surprisingly this have not even been reviewed yet. I have now had to move in with my in laws as office closure means I have to work from home and have no internet. I have chased and chased to no avail.

Why keep things simple when you can make it 1,000 times more complicated?After 3 months of refusing to pay them another penny I finally got the ever growing bills cancelled but that wasn't enough for BT they then decided to cut the phone line off from my old business leaving the new owner without a line and insisting he pays for a new line and contract.I will never deal with BT again in my life and I will do my upmost to make sure all friends, relatives and acquaintances never do either.

I didn't recieve an email, text or call (even though I had called them to sort out my email address after that date). In November, they cut my services citing the fact that they hadn't tried to take out a direct debit since February. I still hadn't recieved a text or email alerting me to the debt. They told me that due to Covid, there would be some things they could do to cut down the amount I had to pay- at that point it was about £280 and of course, due to Covid, I couldn't pay it all at once. They told me they would call me back within the month to help me out with my bill and set up a new direct debit. In the beginning of December they cut my broadband off again without an email or any contact whatsoever. They said my bill had raised to 480 and they refused to do anything to help, and said if I didn't pay 127 a month, I would have no broadband because they had locked my account.

"Incompetent, sly, underhanded bullies!!!","I am 60 years of age. I took out a broadband package with bt just before March lockdown began, 2020. Part of the contract was to include an engineer call out to install the modem. This never happened. Instead, I was left to install the modem myself, irrespective of the fact that I had told this company I have bipolar and, despite having really tried, I had been unsuccessful in my best efforts to follow the instructions re: installation. I telephoned disinterested bt, totally frustrated by having tried so hard to do their engineer's job for them, and parted with a lot of money via debit card during the course of that conversation. I was led to believe by bt that this ended the contract...the contract they themselves had broken, as no engineer was ever sent out. They had offered no other solution or, indeed, any ongoing support whatsoever. Bt, only in the last couple of months, have since been pursuing me using a debt recovery agency, increasing the amount they claim I owe them  by £100 per month! If bt think they are going to win out against me, then they are more deluded than I could ever be. Maybe I should recommend my medication to them, or a good support package of their own, although the NHS would indeed struggle in installing any kind of humanity into the circus company that otherwise goes by the name of bt. My social worker rang bt to lambast them,  and yet I have still received another letter by the debt recovery agency bt are still pinning their vaugest hopes on with a view to further fleecing me. The debt recovery agency Laurel and Hardies informed me, via their second letter, just before Christmas, that I had not rung them, even though I had,  undisputed by themselves in my second telephone conversation with them last week. Stand up to bullying opportunists. They are nothing but toothless hopefuls when it gets right down to it!

They don't tell you how to claim the switching costs, all they do is wait until you complain and it's too late to get a termination letter from your incumbent provider and don't say that they need a specific letter, dated in a certain date and they'll only pay a fraction of it. In fact, they won't pay any if it, even if you clearly demonstrate that you have paid ongoing and outstanding fees with your incumbent provider and email them the evidence. You need to roll a 7, with one dice, to get the money. They won't acknowledge what was said by the conman salesperson either (or not said). My recommendation is to go to the Financial Ombudsman. Win or lose, it costs them £500 for the process. Don't change early, it will only benefit BT and they won't pay switching fees, even if they promise to. I work for a larger financial institution than BT and we have a similar option. Unlike BT, we tell new customers what they need to do at point if sale. If they can't satisfy the full criteria, we sign it off anyway as long as they can demonstrate they have ongoing costs, even if it is not the letter we asked for. What's the point in arguing, we get a happy customer that doesn't leave, doesn't complain, doesn't go to the financial ombudsman, doesn't keep emailing us and phoning us, doesn't cost our services time and money and we care about our customers. If they can prove they have ongoing costs and we've promised to pay it, we pay it. Why waste each other's time. Why don't you see sense BT and have some consideration for your customers, your ongoing costs and your staff? With the time I'm taking up speaking to your staff and the £500 financial ombudsman fee, why make it so hard?",Barry,2021,1,9,1,0.076,0.081,Positive
BT - a disgrace to the United Kingdom,"It is time OFCOM and the Government got off their backsides and dealt with BT once and for all. BT customer service is APPALLING. For faults BT says it is NOT responsible because it is the responsibility of its subsidiary Openreach. The law on contract is quite clear - BT is responsible.  BT, which for many years has had a dire reputation, fails time and time and time and time again. I doubt this Government will dare tackle BT......too many envelopes to stuff.This company is a disgrace to the United Kingdom.",David,2021,1,9,1,0.208,0.055,Negative

I was stuck on BT for several years as no one else would provide a service to my property, would be on the phone to them daily until they just started putting me on hold then hanging up on me.

ZERO STARS,ZERO STARS! Absolutely awful “customer service”. We moved to bt who totally messed up the swap so I was left without incoming calls (which I needed for part of my job). After numerous calls they eventually said it was a fault their end and we had to cancel everything off with them which  would take 2 weeks then re-set everything up which would take another 2 weeks. I explained this needed to be urgent as I needed the phone line for work and am having unauthorised unpaid absences as a result (they didn’t care). They promised to keep us updated throughout (LIES) and 2 weeks later when I rang they said their had been a fault on their end cancelling it and he would get it cancelled now and said he don’t know why we was told 2 weeks it can be cancelled in 24 hours! I said DO NOT set it back up when it’s cancelled I want to make a complaint and go to another provider. We spoke to a manager who assured us once it had been closed off we would be offered a compensation package. 24 hours later it was cancelled and off we went back to sky. 3 weeks later we ring as we’ve heard nothing about our complaint to be told not only has a complaint not been raised.. there’s no notes at all that we’ve ever spoken to a manager and that they don’t over compensation apparantly according to “off com” regulations and offered us £30 Goodwill. We did not accept and asked to speak to a manager. The manager was rude and contradicted herself constantly. Saying they don’t offer compensation only goodwill due to offcom regulations. Then said they only offer compensation if a service hasn’t been provided which should of. I said that’s exactly what’s happened here!! But she insisted it’s £30 GW or nothing. Eventually she upped it to £60 “goodwill” but was unapologetic and sarcastic. The WORST experience and customer service I have ever ever dealt with & going by the reviews it seems they treat all their customers this way. Awful BT. You certainly won’t ever be getting my custom again or anyone else’s I know! Good riddance!!!,clair homer,2021,1,9,1,0.111,0.044,Negative

This is one of the worst companies that…,"This is one of the worst companies that I've ever dealt with in my life. Please don't be fooled by the corporate name and household name. A bt employee has told me that bt business are one of the largest crooks out there... An absolute shocking company that will try every trick to lure you in but once you make the mistake of signing up with them countless errors, mistakes with billing, zero customer service, countless calls for hours on end with no resolution. 16 calls later not resolved. I employed a telecoms expert and paid him to resolve...issue still there.....they should be reported to ombudsman at each and every chance and taken to the courts, only then they admit their mistakes. I'm shocked at how they behave and what they are allowed to get away with. They owed my account around 500.00 gbp and kept promising credit , but no sign of credit instead letters threatening me with further action when it was actually them that owed me money, does that make any sense ? In my last call the lady admitted all of this and said they owed us a lot of credit but wanted to do some sort of deal with me so that they wouldn't have to pay ? What ??!!Be careful and don't assume you will be safe just because of the household name....Not trustworthy, not honest there are hundreds of better options out there Goodluck and I hope this review helps you steer well clear of this shocking company",Amar,2021,1,8,1,0.13,0.175,Positive

Great experience so far.,I was supposed to have a brand new installation before Xmas but the engineer didn’t bring the right equipment. Another engineer (Mark) came out today and (understandably) couldn’t do the work outside due to health and safety reasons and not having the right safety equipment and the pole my wires need to connect to has been damaged and he needed a hoist. He left the job but told me to call BT gave me a list of what they needed to put on the account and told me I may be able to get a hub while I have to wait for another visit. (I need internet for work and I am a “vulnerable” person). I called BT and spoke to Alysha from their Ireland branch. The was without a doubt the most friendliest and helpful agent I’ve ever spoke to. She gave me a few tips I can use with my job too! She got everything I needed sorted for me and passed me on to another really helpful lady who sorted out a hub for me until my installation is done. She was also really friendly and great to talk to! Both ladies really calmed my anxiety down about the internet. Then to add to this... after I got off the phone the engineer called me again to say he and his work buddy were coming to do all of the work that needed to be done inside of the flat so when the other engineer comes out with the safety gear I’ll be able to get my internet done quicker! Both of the guys were really kind. I may not be on supply yet but the service I have received today has been outstanding. Thank you all!,Customer,2021,1,7,5,0.02,0.178,Positive
I was blatantly lied to by BT customer service,"After 2 years with BT, I have just called BT's customer service as my offer expired and Virgin is offering a much more competitive offer for twice the speed. After 40min of a confusing conversation with a representative, during I was put on hold for a few minutes at a time while ""she tried to secure a better deal for me from her manager"", she assured me the she had a fantastic deal for me, which was a special offer to reward me for my loyalty, and for having chosen BT for the past 2 years. I asked many times if she was able to reduce the price a bit further and she assured me that this was ""the best possible discount she could get"", that it was a very special one, that only very few people got - ""only very upset customers"". I foolishly trusted her and accepted the offer, and now have checked and seen that what was meant to be a ""very special deal"" to ""reward me for my loyalty"" is indeed what you offer ALL new customers. Absolutely zero efforts made. I feel completely lied to, and I have immediately cancelled the order - if I have been lied to about this, what else should I not be trusting about this company's service?

DO NOT USE BT Internet - multiple GDPR breaches,DO NOT USE BT Internet - I am reporting BT to the ICO for breaching my data protection rights.  I called to set up a new internet connection for my new home.  They confirmed all my personal details yet still went on to set the account up at my new address in my ex husband's name (he was registered to my old address).  They have now given my ex husband my new home address and have locked me out of the account and will only deal with him.  They accepted they made an error.  They accepted they have breached my data protection rights.  They promised they would cancel the new contract.  Yet they are still sending bills to my new home address in my ex husbands name linking us via credit checks.  I'm appalled by their actions.  Their actions are putting people at risk by sharing home addresses with ex partners without consent and without any legitimate reason.
