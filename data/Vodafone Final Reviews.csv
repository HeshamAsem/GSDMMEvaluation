3,If your looking to spend hours and…,"If your looking to spend hours and hours on the phone dealing with Asian representatives of Vodafone trying to resolve issues your having with the service then look no further, you have found your cheap broadband provider who at every opportunity will try their very hardest to heap misery on you. The old saying of “you only get what you pay for” is very true in this case, cheap broadband with bad customer service.I managed to get out before I was tied to them for two years by leaving within the 14 days grace period of my contract but even that had its drama, twice I was threatened with a early termination fee, the Asian team thought it was ok to use this tactic to stop me leaving the service and then after I cancelled the service the broadband still remained and again I spent hours on the phone telling Vodafone that I had cancelled the service and wouldn’t be paying for a discontinued service which consumed my whole Saturday morning. Vodafone customer service is one of the worst I have ever experienced.",jon newstart,2022,1,16,1,0.127,0.053,Negative
4,Went into the vodaphone shop in…,"Went into the vodaphone shop in Solihull in November 2021. Me and my wife upgraded our phone's. The member id staff was very helpful. Your days later my received her phone. I didn't. It's now been several weeks and still no new phone. After phoning several times sometimes taking over an hour to get through and being given so many different excuses why my phone hadn't come. My daughter eventually spoke to a senior manager who admitted some of the information given was incorrect and to quite ""we'll have to put this on our staff training courses"". This was two weeks ago and he said that he would sort it but was unable to give a date when my phone will arrive. The customer service is appalling. Next time we want a new phone it will not be with Vodaphone. If you do care about your customers get your act together.",Geoff Millington,2022,1,16,1,0.031,0.058,Positive
5,Wish I'd stayed with Three Mobile,Wish I'd stayed with Three Mobile. Mobile internet is patchy and slow. In my work (in a city) can barely get reception where before I had a super fast connection.

6,I’ve been left disgusted and…,I’ve been left disgusted and disappointed by a company I’ve stayed loyal to for over 20 years. Their customer service is at an all time low. Tried to over charge me on a sim only deal. The same deal my husband got 12 months ago. Wouldn’t take my word on how much my husband was paying. Told him my husband would give him his details to check he wouldn’t do it. Didn’t care that I had decided to move to a rival company. On the plus side had a lovely helpful guy at carphone warehouse who was only to happy to have my custom. Had told me he had a lot of unhappy Vodafone customers in!!,NS,2022,1,15,1,0.088,0.133,Positive

8,Terrible customer service,"Vodafone make frequent mistake incorrectly charging for services. For example, every year I get charged twice for my Spotify service. Getting hold of a customer representative on the phone is an incredibly frustrating experience, they make it very hard and it takes a huge amount of time spent on hold. They could make the customer experience better with simple things, e.g. the possibility to request a call back or giving a time estimate of how long the wait is. They should learn from Apple or Amazon for what good customer service is.",mbp,2022,1,15,1,0.092,0.123,Positive
9,Terrible service,"Terrible service, they were unable to transfer my number through after giving them a PAC Code, I've had no service on my phone for a week and they keep delaying it.

10,My review is 20 years late,"My review is 20 years late. I bought an LG shine with vodaphone when they first came out. There was a line down the screen, so I sent it straight back for repairs. Which took 3 months. 3 months where I was still charged for the contract and I recieved my phone back with a letter saying they found no problem. Lss, I incurred a £900 bill for a phone I refused to accept, and a ccj, and they are nothing but crooks.",Adam,2022,1,15,1,0.087,0.046,Negative
11,I’ll never return to Vodafone,"I’ll never return to Vodafone. Upgraded 2020, was advised on the call that after 12 months I could upgrade for free if I returned the handset but I could wait 18 months, keep the handset and upgrade for free - Lies, and apparently they haven’t got the call recording! Either way I was willing to still upgrade and renew this month, however the prices are ridiculous and they’ve changed from 24 month contracts to 36 months. £85 per handset (I had 2 with them)?! No chance. EE gave me the same phone, more data and apple care for £104 a month for both handsets. Vodafone wrecked my credit file in the early days for no reason (no missed payments but reported them as missed and wouldn’t remove the marks), tried to rip me off this upgrade and conned me into upgrading back in 2020.",Gage,2022,1,14,1,0.116,0.104,Negative
12,Broadband companies are total failures!!!,"Just another lousy company, had to leave EE only to find their customer service is equally as bad as EE none existing at all. Broadband running, they forgot to let EE know to cut that line off and know I have broadband but not knowing what package I have what I pay or anything else. Have not given a working account to check or to get any knowledge of it. Using a Website to look into it and the only way for me to correspond to Voda but I been totally ignored.In England not where I live we have a worthwhile working broadband company, we never had. The all got the same attitude as No 10. Looks like another ombudsman job.Rotten customer service and it stinks. They take your money and run. Stay clear of Virgin media because they never turned up to do the job and had a subcontractor of theirs had to borrow my tools to dig a trench but the router and mobiles never came.",EARTHLING,2022,1,14,1,0.082,0.057,Negative
13,Criminally bad service,Just spent 4 hours in store trying to cancel contract for gigacube that won’t work.  Store manager tried too for hours and gave up.  People answer after 50 minutes but then hang up.   The manager was swearing at how bad his own company was!!!  I can see on here lots of people saying similar - I can’t believe the government haven’t intervened to stop this company.   It’s actually criminally bad as it’s taking peoples money and then just refusing to answer.   I am down 330 for gigacube and a contract of 40 a month for a service that doesn’t exist and can’t be stopped!,John Teall,2022,1,14,1,0.208,0,Negative

I asked to cancel the service as this is useless to me but was informed that I was out of my cancellation period.

I ordered mine on 30/12/21 and I booked everything online then I got message from Vodafone that I won’t have engineer visit as my line is active. I called them and informed we had refurbishment in the house and we do not have master socket anymore so we will need engineer visit. After this I called 8 times to confirm this. And even after confirming time slot for engineer between 8 am to 1 pm, on the day of the appointment they cancelled an engineer and when I called to check at 12:30 pm they told me there is no engineer needed. They wasted my two weeks and time in chase up calls. I think they don’t understand customer or they can’t read notes on my account. And now they are saying they can’t book an engineer until the service is active but they don’t understand there is no socket to plug in router as there is no line. Pathetic service!!

27,WORST NIGHTMARE with CANCEL ORDER and MOVING THE NUMBER,"I've been having the WORST nightmare with vodafone, since 30th of December. I got offered a monthly package when I was pay as you go customer. The call agent calling me didn't even see that I was already a vodafone customer and sent me a new simcard with a new number. I tried to cancel the order, when I understood the situation but it was IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL. I said ok I will move my number, yet after days, they couldn't still move my number to the new simcard. Their call agents are a nightmare, you cannot do or get what you want, impossible processes, everything is a mess, each call agent tells something different. The process takes ages, and in their favor. I hated Vodafone So much that I will tell each person that I know and on the internet about this horrible experience, If they fail to move my number tomorrow, I'm cancelling the stupid order.

36,"Vodafone is poorly managed, has poor products, poor UI's and poor service","I was trying to get my phone plan to work while I am abroad for 3 months. I first tried to upgrade my vodafone plan through the website, but this of course does not work on their awful site so you have to talk to the awful chatbot and when it inevitably doesn't work you  have to wait 100 places in a queue to talk to someone. After I got an adviser, they offered me the ridiculous prices of £32 a month or £25 a month with an additional £2 daily charge everyday I would use it. These extortionate packages offered only 100 minutes abroad, so I obviously didn't take these. I then tried to apply for a voxi sim card because they seemed reasonable, but I wouldn't be able to keep my number if I got a new voxi card because I already had a vodafone plan so for some reason the PAC code wouldn't work to transfer the number (ridiculous that this is a rule). I was then told I could get a voxi plan on my santander card instead, and was transfered between 3 people before being told I had to be in the UK to have the voxi plan on my card. They then suggested I send my current card back to the UK to then have the voxi plan put on it and then have it sent back to me in spain. This all took around 4 hours of sitting on the chat system on both voxi and santander sites.At every step throughout this horrendous ordeal I was asked to supply a security code. I had to repeat EVERY SINGLE TIME that I was abroad and could not receive any messages or calls to receive the code. I was transferred even more between different people because of this code issue. If I could have paid for the code message to go through to me if I could have, but vodafone's applications and integration to android phones is so bad that this option is nowhere to be found.

38,Avoid like the plague.,"Avoid like the plague.Internet cut off without warning yesterday.  After 2 hours not being able to speak to someone and following diagnostics and half taking apart the land line system to preclude hardware issues, I discover they had cut us off for non payment of a £21 bill that was charged in error,  part of which was a £5 late payment fee for another mistake they had made.  Don't get me wrong we had payed the broadband and landline bill - this was something else -  when we finally got through,  even they did not know what this payment was for,  but refused to switch is back on until we paid it. We moved house last June and I have practically given up on the monthly several hours on the phone to correct their errors.

39,Getting absolutely no where with Vodafone complaints department,"I’m so frustrated with the Vodafone customer journey even after writing directly to the CEO twice I am getting no where. I decided to upgrade my phone December last year after being with Vodafone for the past 24 years chose to remain loyal. I’ve had nothing but issues since. They assured me I would have the phone before Christmas 3 times and this did not happen, it took nearly 4 weeks to deliver a phone? Then since getting the phone there has been issues connecting my device to service so I have been left effectively with no phone! The person dealing with the complaint is never in the office and no one else seems to be able to pick up my queries? They have now confirmed they have to take the phone back as there seems to be issues with it, but have said they cannot replace that model as they don’t have any?! They haven’t even provided me with an alternative resolution.It’s beyond belief the lack of interest in customer service. Working in the regulated environment myself I am astounded by Vodafone’s attitude and lack of urgency around resolve or even keeping me updated as to what they are or are not the case may be, attempting to do for me.Having sent an email yesterday outlining my expectations I still have no response, and unlikely to get one as the case officer is out of office.

57,Couldn't possibly be any worse,"Dreadful, frequent network outages. Left me with no mobile service or broadband over xmas and new year and it has failed twice again since then. Their customer service is a joke. When you do complain all you get is a scripted response from someone who may as well be a robot. No escalation route, completely ignored anything I said and just continued the generic responses. I made them aware that I considered them not providing the service was a breach of contract and I wished to terminate, this was completely ignored as well. Made me a measly compensation offer that didn't ever cover my bill for the period I was unable to use the service. I'm just waiting now to be able to refer it to the Ombudsman.From Vodafones benefit... For clarity when I said broadband I meant mobile 4g broadband that's why both services have been down at the same time and still down today. I don't use facebook or twitter not that I expect to get any sense out of vodafone there either, and when I said Ombudsman I meant CISAS not that I expect them to be able to fix your network when you seem incapable of doing that yourselves.

Everything seems fine for me.However, since then I kept receiving bill afterward and it went to CCSCollect. I contacted Vodafone online services again, they were not able to look up my previous conversation and insisted me to pay the bill.What a dishonest business and unreliable customer services!!!Lesson Learnt: Don't rely on their website said they will email you the conversation history after conversation ends. if it ended and you did not receive your email, there are no ways to get it back.So, make a print screen manually or save as pdf",Wilson,2022,1,10,1,0.079,0.051,Negative

70,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!,"It goes without saying that this is generally the worst company I have ever had the pleasure in paying to be taken the **** out of on every point of contact. If you value yourself, don’t get a contract out here. Pay more as it will be worth every penny. Just a little backstory. I have actually been with Vodafone for around 7 years. The usual let downs but nothing to horrendous. All until I decided to go from my Sim only plan and also get my other half’s contract added on as it was ending with EE. Even trying to take out the new contracts it was painful. I think it took around 5 attempts after being cut off on web chats and phone calls. Was told when the phones where arriving and they didn’t and constantly had to keep chasing. This is where things took a turn. So, my number was staying the same and my partners needed to be swapped over to their original. After giving the details to the agent they for some reason got confused by the numbers and didn’t change over correctly and the agent actually removed my number completely. It took 8 days to get my number back, yes I didn’t have my phone number for 8 days. I was just met with I’m sorry and appreciate the inconvenience. I had to chase everyday as nobody would contact me. After being lied to on many occasions by different agents I was the one who had to bring up the conversation of compensation as I think they forgot I was the one who was actually paying for the privilege of this. I was met with a very kind offer of £40 with 8 days without a phone. Being self employed this actually caused a real big inconvenience to me. I obviously declined the offer and they went away to their supervisor who came back with £100. And this is where it gets my back up. You as a company clearly have no value for the people who actually keep you business alive. I again declined the offer. I was then met with £150 compensation. Just goes to show how much things go up when you challenge. I declined this again and was told I could speak to the supervisor directly. I thought great, least I can speak to someone who MIGHT actually be able to help me and see things from the customers point of view. The gentleman Paul came on the phone and said would I like to explain the situation. I mentioned he clearly knows what the issue is but have a brief run down. The first words that came out of Pauls mouth was, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT! and proceeded to basically challenge everything which seemed strange to me considering I wasn’t the one who caused the issue. Paul then explained to me the £150 more than covers enough for my inconvenience. I asked Paul why he came onto the call with so much animosity towards me. He seemed to be taken back by this. I said to Paul that he doesn’t need to be so personal about this considering he doesn’t own Vodafone and should relax and help me with my issue rather than creating another one. Paul then piped down and said he would raise it higher and they would investigate the issue. I was told this would be done within 5 days. On the 6 day phoned to then be told it would take 10 days! Just a classic thing from Vodafone, told one thing when it means another. They came back and said £150 was more than enough and the notes on my complaint from then again started with! WITH ALL DUE RESPECT! I don’t know how you train your agents but this is not customer service. I couldn’t bare to even speak to them anymore as honestly it just gets under my skin. I then received a text to say that I had an overdue Bill with them as few days later, which seemed strange to me considering they had already taken money from account. You know, the direct debit which had been in place for years. I was told that for some reason my bank had declined the DD not due to a funds issue but just declined. Just a back story that this has happened before I had even renewed the contract and I’m only being told this now. I said I have no issue paying the bill but I want my current complaint dealt with before I pay this as I want it looked into. Again another issue I haven’t caused but spending hours on the phone dealing with. I was told that this would be fine and that my phone wouldn’t be restricted. Guess what! A couple of days later my phone is restricted. It’s just lies after lies from the company. I paid the amount and just because I couldn’t bare to waste another minute of my life speaking to Vodafone I accepted the £150. If any one is in this situation, they only use this amount for your Air time plan and not the phone. But yet wasn’t told about this. Life resumed and then starting having issues with my phone using internet when not on the Wi-Fi. After MANY attempts speaking to them i was told i would need a new SIM card. 5 days later the Sim arrives and I proceeded to do a sim swap of the number. I have spent another 5 days being lied to and chasing to get this done. 24 hours turning into 72.

77,"Not the company it was, tactics of a budget brand when they are very expensive!","Vodafone are not the same company in my opinion, the one I signed up to four years ago  rewarded it’s existing customers with better upgrades than a new customer could find. All this has gone and now it reminds me of a budget hotel/business where they try to squeeze you for more and more and if you try to leave it’s not made easy. Firstly the yearly increases, i started my contract the end of December so after 4 months i received something like a 3-5% increase and this continued every 12 months. These contracts aren’t cheap and the increases are not insignificant. There are still companies who do not do this and a quick  search will show who. Second issue is the use of the word unlimited data, it might be unlimited data but they heavily restrict the speeds on the cheaper unlimited option and unless you go reading up on the subject you don’t realise how big an impact this is having. As mentioned earlier, I was surprised to see how expensive my upgrade offer was in comparison to if I was a new customer. The only way to bring the price down nearer to my current budget is to trade in my existing phone or pay the phone off over 3 years. None of which i would need to do if i was a new customer. I even found some December offers cheaper than my current price! Speaking to Vodafone made no difference, they were not able to offer any improved deal. The conversation ended with them saying I would pay £25 a month on Sim only when the contract ends. I don’t know if the issues requesting the PAC code were due to vodafone or not but i was met with a reply of we can’t provide this at the moment due to technical difficulties. Reading online this isn’t an isolated incident, it appears to happen more frequent frustrating those trying to leave. At the end of December while trying multiple times over multiple days to review my upgrade options again, the website would not function and i could not get my account details. I ended up forgetting about it and had a surprise bill of £87 for the rolling contract price for Jan. £87 for data only which would cost £25 normally, that is outrageous! I read Vodafone can get away with charging this amount at the end of a contract because they don’t separate the phone charge from the airway cost, but wait…. they do now!Right now I want a Sim only deal on a rolling 1 month contract. Vodafone sell sim only deals on 30 day, 1 year and 2 year deals to new customers. It states it on there website on the upgrade page also but if you try to upgrade to a sim only, you are only the offered 1 or 2 year option. The 30 day option isn’t even made an option to select! The Vodafone forum where you can ask for advice etc, the people responding are not coming across impartial to me, they are heavily weighted in Vodafones favour to the point it appears cult like in response or possibly not genuine. Some of the responses are shocking and i suspect successful at stopping people from raising complaints or contacting the ombudsman. Overall I would not recommend, it will likely cost you more than you think and there are better companies out there who are more honest and upfront.",Lee ,2022,1,7,1,0.072,0.066,Negative

The rest, appalling.","The last three days have been an absolute nightmare with Vodafone.......save for my experience in Vodafone Touchwood (Solihull) with Jay, late morning on Thursday 6th January.Jay was brilliant from the word ""go."" Unlike everyone else I dealt with (in the Redditch store), at Customer Care (misnomer, two specialists tried to help.  Alex ""dug deep""but when I did as he instructed, it didn't work. Dree didn't really try then completely failed to deliver and Christine in Fraud was utterly appalling - spoke to her at 12.25 on Thursday 6 January.  She was inappropriately familiar - calling me repeatedly by my first name whilst questioning my identity.  She called me ""darling"" at one point....yet, when I explained that my daughter, whose number this is all about, whose phone I pay for - was suffering with severe illness and absolutely needed her phone - her only point of contact with the outside world, she was callously dismissive, ""there is no way this can be removed"" anytime soon). Jay seemed to see the human aspect of our situation from the start.  He was entirely appropriate but he went beyond simply ""going through the motions.""His immediate grasp of the situation, his tolerance of the awful Christine (I heard how insulting to him she was), his determination to avoid my having to drive to London (120+ miles when snow is forecast and I am a pensioner) and his overall insight, intelligence and fabulous client awareness, was beyond parallel.  He even bought me a bottle of water as he spotted I was ""wilting.""This young man needs to be promoted big-time.With someone like Jay at the helm, Vodafone would be so very very much better.  Recognition needs to be given to this young man - absolutely stellar.  He is the best sales assistant I have ever dealt with - in my long life.  He utterly renewed my faith in the company - which Vodafone have done all possible to kill off, this week.Look at the awful reviews on Vodafone.Vodafone's customer care staff are (believe Alex did his best, but after two hours on Wed 5 January 2022 - to no avail - he was unsuccessful) beyond bad. Their lack of concern for my severely ill daughter - who calls the Samaritans often - is tantamount to being actively cruel/negligent/coercive on the path of an individual to crisis/destruction.  I didn't mention the degree of my daughter's illness to Jay.  I didn't need to.  He entirely ""got"" the human element. It was clear his only aim was to make the situation workable, whilst observing the boundaries in place.But what is wrong with all your other employees?Does Vodafone recruit the least personable people available - for whom ""customer care""is actually an opportunity to flex the power muscle?

They also claim to be unable to get me a replacement device until the first one has returned to them, which, due to DPD, is liable to take many days, if they even bother. At this point, I have no faith that DPD is going to actually deliver, or that vodafone will ever actually force them to do so, or that I am going to get any other response from vodafone than ""well, they said they'll deliver, you'll just have to wait, or get them to send it back and we'll send another one out once that's happened."" So next step is probably to go to O2, get the same phone on the equivalent contract (which I can do same day), and then go back to vodafone and cancel the upgrade, then cancel my mobile account, and if they try and raise huge termination fees, I'll see them in court for breach of contract (no device provided).Avoid this bunch, all they care about is their precious procedures.",Andrew,2022,1,5,1,0.075,0.065,Negative

113,SCAM COMPANY,"SCAM COMPANY! WATCH OUT! Trying for 2 years to get my £300 refund! Vodafone keep taking money from my account for month although the phone that I bought with them was paid already. What a shame way of making money, by scamming their customers. Don’t recommend and would suggest to never set a debit direct with this company.On 05 May 2018 I signed an agreement with Vodafone that included a monthly payment of an Apple iPhone X 64GB space grey and monthly plan that includes UK unlimited minutes, UK 40 GB data and UK unlimited texts. I paid upfront charge of £29. With equipment value of £1036.20 to be paid monthly with the plan through a direct debit throughout my account. I finished paying the phone on 05 May 2020. But, although I finished paying the phone. Vodafone continue to remove from my account at 15 May £88.32, 17 June another £ 88.32, 15 July another £ 88.32.Noticed that something wasn’t right I went to Vodafone store at Marble Arch ( they closed the store last year) to complain that they were removing inadequately money from my account. The assist at the store told me that they couldn’t refund the money that was my business to not notice that they were still charging a phone that was paid and that was also my bank fault. Very disgusting this. So, I told him that this is not right that when I sign the contract I was told that when I finished pay the phone they would only charge me the plan and that then I could upgrade for another phone if I wanted. Then, I told him that I wanted the company to stop removing money from my account just to notice that afterwards that on 17 August another £ 93,29 was removed from my account even though I complained.I had to report a scam for my bank to cancel my previous card in order to Vodafone stop removing money from my account.Then, I called Vodafone customer services several times and went to several store including in Bath High Street. Initially I was told that I would received my money back and that a manager would call me . Off course they didn’t called me. I called them back several times and I was told that Vodafone actually will not refund my money. Even though my “The Direct Debit Guarantee” states that:- If there are any changes to the amount, date or frequency of your Direct Debit Vodafone Limited will notify you 3 working days in advance of your account being debited or as otherwise agreed. If you request Vodafone Limited to collect a payment, confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request.- If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit by Vodafone Limited or your bank or building Society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of the amount paid from your bank or build society.At the time that I bought my phone and the plan I had a staff discount because of the place they were. Find out later that my company removed Vodafone from their building. They couldn’t have done better. Vodafone doesn’t deserve to be there. If we make the calculations, Vodafone inappropriately removed £358.25 during 4 months from my account. I’ve trying to receive the refund, but without any luck. For this reason, I’ve been in contact with ombudsman to try to have my money back.This is how Vodafone makes money, by scamming their customers. This is not right. So, never ever sign for this company or pay by direct debit. SCAM! And then Dean on January 3rd, through Messenger at 20:57, because I complained on Facebook, accessed my account and just told me that they had the right to remove £358.25 from my account! And advised me to continue making my complaint! The epicentre of the scam! AVOID  Vodafone! This is how they make money! They are not concerned about customer experience, instead they are concerned in stealing your money. That’s how their customer service works! Charlatans!

114,Absolute con artists,"Absolute con artists, be warned their Lite data plan means it’s so lite you can’t use it.. I bought an add on to my contract for unlimited data which was called unlimited Lite, and yes they put the download/ upload speed in the fine print but little did I know that would slow the internet down just for simple browsing. So in a nutshell where you think LITE would mean for browsing only - that doesn’t work, so I pay more monthly now, as they refuse to put it back to original data package and in essence I can’t use any internet from the upgraded package because it doesn’t  work! So be ware - LITE data plan means you will pay more but we won’t let you actually use the internet as there is a cap on speed.. well what can the LITE actually be used for if internet browsing doesn’t even work on it? Google search - takes about 1 and a half minute to load;Facebook- that will load if you’re lucky;Ring camera - you can forget about that full stop.Can’t wait for the contract to end, will never use them again!Customer service saying they will help but offer no solution apart from “will let you upgrade early without charge..” to another shocking package?

When requesting further information about when the issue will be resolved the information is minimal giving no insight for the house hold to plan work and other activities.  Vodafone simply states that we will be compensated for every 24hrs with little thought of the actual issues caused.  This is unacceptable in a time where people are reliant on internet providers to work around the constraints of a global pandemic.  Further to this the network was newly installed in the area by city fibre and there have been no adverse weather conditions not justify the degree of outage.  3 days(and counting) internet outage with no indication of when the issue will be resolved is unacceptable and I have never suffered from this level of down time or lack of communication from a service provider.

Attempting to purchase a new contract and simply migrating my number has been nothing but 3 days worth of headache. Beware when purchasing a new phone contract via 3rd party supplier i.e Carphone Warehouse, Mobiles direct. If you already have a Vodafone contract they will say you can not migrate (PUK) your number to the new Vodafone contract. You must purchase a pay-as-you-go sim, (PUK) migrate your number to that, and then move it to the new contract. (REALLY!) This is something other service providers can sort out within a few hours.

128,The worst customer experience I have ever had.,"The worst provider experience I have ever had. As I was looking to move on from Three, I chose Vodafone as they had reasonable pay monthly offers. After purchasing a pay monthly plan and submitting my PAC code to transfer my Three number, I was instantly hit with issues creating an account, sorting delivery of my sim, and speaking to customer service with big wait times, even on the live chat. After all this, I decided to just cancel the Vodafone contract with the sim which still hadn’t arrived. I was told you can’t cancel anywhere other than by calling them, which I did after another long wait, and on the call they also confirmed that my Three mobile number will not be moved over and the transfer request had been successfully cancelled. After the mess with Vodafone, I chose a different contract with EE with the same number transfer process. Once my EE sim arrived, my Three sim stopped working as the number was transferred and released, but unfortunately not transferred to EE. At this point it seemed my Three number had vanished into thin air. EE told me they did not have my number and to get a new PAC code, and Three couldn’t get a new PAC code as the number had already been released by them. I endured two and a half weeks of discussions and being sent round in circles between Three, EE and Vodafone, who were all saying my Three number was not with them and each telling me to speak to the other provider. I was in so many live chats that in the end I gave up and had to write an email directly to the EE CEO, who finally got me in touch with a senior member of the EE team. They were extremely helpful, and explained that the number was most likely with Vodafone and guided me through the usual number transfer process. I finally spoke to someone at Vodafone who could confirm my Three number had actually been transferred to them but was inactive. Despite me cancelling the contract, having someone confirm to me multiple times it would not be moved over, and many hours speaking to tech support members at Vodafone who were also all saying they didn’t have my number at Vodafone, it was still transferred to them. The tech support member who finally told me Vodafone had my number said the only way to get a new PAC code was to get a new pay-as-you-go Vodafone sim, have my Three number moved on to it, then request a new PAC code from that pay-as-you-go sim. The guy in the Vodafone store also told me that my number wasn’t with them, but I just bought a sim anyway. After buying the sim with the mandatory £10 minimum top up, I spoke to someone else on the tech support team at Vodafone who told me that they could just send me the PAC code and I didn’t actually need to get a pay-as-you-go sim. To top it off, when I put the £10 Vodafone pay-as-you-go sim in my phone to call them, I received a message saying that I was part of a top up plan, and I was now going to be charged £10 a month. I definitely didn’t agree to that and was automatically opted in, and the only way to cancel… was to call them up again and do it over the phone. I have honestly never had a worse customer experience in my entire life, and I would genuinely avoid Vodafone like the plague. There are massive wait times over the phone and on the live chat in comparison to EE and Three, and everyone on the tech support team seems to tell you something different each time you contact them.

Their robot support is useless and it is literally impossible to speak to anyone when you have a problem. They have gone for full automation. The problem is they haven't built the app or robots well enough. The app is constantly 'too busy' so you can't use it. It doesn't update when changes are made. How a company like this is able to survive is incredible. I too wish I had read the reviews. Once my contract expires I will never ever have anything to do with them again.,Jason Surfleet,2021,12,31,1,0.098,0.087,Negative

132,Id like to see them put out of business,"Decided on a seemingly good deal and decided to set up online - was charged and sent no confirmation via email as I would expect from any purchase. Tried to create an account and the website displayed 'We’re currently experiencing issues with our Digital services' (This has been that way since about 0300).Chatted with someone this morning who seemed helpful, he said sometimes the website times out and does not register a sale, he advised that I will be getting my money back within a couple of days. I was undeterred about the device, I still wanted it, so I decided to spend the next 40 mins using their web chat, working out the sale. All of a sudden, he disappears, whilst I was waiting for confirmation the chat was closed (no problems with my internet at the time). I have given up on the device and am now looking for closure/ peace of mind that I will indeed get my money back because I do not trust them. I have now been on hold for 1hr, and am slowly losing the will to live.These days, superior companies truly understand the value of customer service. I don't know how Vodaphone still exists, it boggles the mind. We have each had our own experiences in dealing with them, My brief encounter, will only ever be that now.

If you sign up for an 18 months contract for Gigacube I think you are doomed !Vodafone says the speeds are up to 1 Gbps (knew that was hokum), you can only reach a max speed of 250 Mbps during the night (which is decent but what’s the use ?) btw I am right next to the 5g mobile mast.  Coming to customer service, its non-existent I mean you can reach out on chat and phone if you don’t have anything better to do!  the agents are trained to talk nicely and all but end of the day you can’t get what you set out to do!  The agents have no clue what they are dealing with, all they do is transfer you from one department(whatever) to other, ask the same question and eventually the call drops or you give upPersonally, I have not seen such pathetic levels of service in recent times I mean there are no words to describe. Don’t think Vodafone cares or they take customer feedback or service seriously, I wonder how do they get away and continue to do business with such attitude and products, sorry for the long text I am only taking time to write this for the benefit of consumers, all the best!",SP,2021,12,22,1,0.108,0.12,Positive

After many calls to VF they couldn't fix the issue and wouldn't send out another router to eliminate the issue so told me put up with it or cancel. I have now upgraded to 900MB Dec 2020 and although the router cuts out less, i now only get 400-500MB on a directed CAT5 connection with WIFI off. VF say that is more than fine on the 900MB even though you pay for 900MB if you get half that speed they will not do anymore to help you. Escalates your issue to second line which give you 48hrs to respond including screen shots 3 times a day. Funny enough I have to go to work to pay for the broadband. I get the screen shots to them in 2 days and they email back saying your call has been closed. The Customer Service at VF is a complete joke and that's if you manage to get through on the phone.

I contacted them and again it wasn't fixed then a couple of weeks later I couldn't make text so they left me where I couldn't make or receive texts so I went onto the head office and contacted them about it to make a complaint miraculously the problem of text with salt with a few minutes of me contacting head office and a couple of weeks later every number I got had + 44 before it so when somebody rang me I didn't recognise the number because of the 44 before it I rang them again no luck they did not fix this problem I had reason to contact them because the internet pages were freezing I like to go back and then go forward to get to the place I was but it seems to do it when I put it password some things in and they didn't seem to be bothered about this so I contacted them because I got sick of the +44 business and said I want to cancel my contract with you and apparently you can't do that you have to pay your rental price for the length of the contract so I said I wasn't paying it and a person rang me up to apologise and asked how could they fix the problem and said I've already told you multiple times what the problem was on you didn't fix it so I want to end the contract after a few minutes she agreed to waive the rental price for the SIM and before cutting me off she has given me time to connect to another network aren't used to ring me back in 3-weeks to terminate the contract.

Their online chat is designed to prolong the “customer service experience” and make you believe they are about to help you, before stating at the very last minute that you are speaking to the wrong person and pass you around the circle. They will do this for hours and days, and know they can. If you think you are making progress… don’t. They are clearly trained to do this and bore you into b**gering off. I know the benchmark for mobile operators is a low one, but let’s not forget that this particular company were in the past voted worst mobile operator for 8 years in a row! Quite something! Says something that they employ an army of staff to monitor and respond to their social media posts.Look. Vodafone are rubbish. People pay to *leave*, not join! I want to pay to leave but they won’t reduce my termination fee by the amount they have offered to refund me this month for a non-functioning network in my area *again* (very reasonable request I think… the refund/credit is mine regardless and I’m not trying to blag a freebie). But what does it say about them if people like me want to PAY to leave them formore reliable service elsewhere!?Give them a miss folks. I also second another reviewer. A common tactic is for their service agent to close the chat before you can hit the email transcript.

Then when we paid & renewed contracts for 3 years. Sales assistant then said oh there could be a delay on delivery as it’s just been Black Friday took over a week to arrive.  Husband phone arrived & was faulty told it would need to be returned for repair. It had just come out of the box & wouldn’t connect to Wi-Fi or 4g. I said no way settling for waiting for a repair after over 1.5 hrs on phone in total to technical & telling her 3 or 4 times it was the black phone out of the order that had the fault.

213,Shockingly bad service but ultimately resolved,"Whatever happened to Vodafone? Having returned after over 10+ years its very clear their customer service has diminished beyond any hope. Whilst buying a new contract via the Vodafone website store was a very straight forward pleasant experience - that I'm afraid is where the pleasant part of the buying experience ends. Speaking to anyone regarding an order afterwards is near on impossible, (waited over an hour half on hold..) live chat is as much good as a chocolate fireguard (when it working that is!) Vodafone seem to think its perfectly acceptable to fob off customers with ""DPD will be touch when your phone is ready for delivery"" while you simply wait...& wait....& wait....hardly no communication on whats going on at all? Tracking provided just sits there with no movement. Twitter support, although friendly advised my order was taken off back order & shouldn't be too long, but zero movement on my tracking.The whole experience has been totally dreadful & I really regret it. I very much doubt I'll get delivery before Xmas Day now, but I have ceased caring if honest.The whole buying process has been a pointless, time-wasting & completely frustrating experience.Whilst I appreciate when things go great few people actually give good feedback, but when its bad they are quick to criticise. I give feedback on my own personal experience (positive & negative) but honestly, do think twice before you buy from Vodafone, worst experience ever (and many think Three UK is bad, oh no..Vodafone is far far worse - I should know I've been with Three for like 10+ years) My feedback to Vodafone would be to sort out your disastrous customer care, non existent communications & false delivery promises. Sadly I expected better from Vodafone. I dont really care anymore when my order arrives as it will be promptly returned back to you for a refund.I'm no longer interested in any further interaction with anyone from Vodafone, so please dont bother with a ""copy n paste"" generic reply. The main purpose of this review is to simply give feedback to other prospective customers.Edit: Since found out via my official complaint my order didn't even exist even after taking £100, receiving all contract docs & a hard credit check on my file. They want me to cancel & re-order?

220,NO INTERNET CONNECTION,"First engineer comes out to set up Wi-Fi in my new flat. Says there’s a fault on the line, and someone else will be out today “if he has time,” (this was around lunchtime). Second guy turns up, does some work on the line, and says that’s me away, give it 5 minutes and it’ll be on. I ask him, knowing in my bones that it wouldn’t work, if there is a number I can contact him on if it doesn’t work. No, it will work, just give it 5. An hour later, when it isn’t working, I call customer services. Nice guy on the phon, not his fault at all, but tells me just leave it to midnight and I am certain it will be working. Guess who wasn’t certain? Me. Guess what wasn’t working? My internet. Call up the next day to report. Same guy on the phone. He says, the line needs more work done. We can get someone out to you on December 24th. I ordered this on the 26/11, got it installed on 17/12, and now it won’t be working until 24/12. I’m working from home. This is absolutely and utterly unacceptable. Told I’ll be compensated £5 per day that there is a delay in service so that I can add more data to my phone so I can work from home. Wish I didn’t take take a risk and go with Vodafone. Never again. Will cancel if I’m able to. STAY WITH YOUR CUSTOMER UNTIL THE INTERNET IS WORKING TO MAKE SURE YOU’VE DONE YOUR JOB.

221,My toilet offers better service,"If the customer servicers so poorly and rudely respond, why work here in the first place? If I knew that I was going to get absolutely blanked for the next 3 hours on phone, followed by the falsely cheerful, completely maddening 'on-hold' Christmas tunes from this appalling provider's company, I would have been convinced never to buy a sim card again.A few days ago, I had purchased a sim only card from Vodafone, only to see that my order had been lazily placed with the wrong number, other than the one I had clearly given them previously. I had decided to give them a call on the situation, to cancel the order.After my first call, I stood for an hour, patiently waiting for any possible response. Guess what? Nothing. Finally, after another twenty minutes, some-one had been bothered to reply. The servicer behind the phone said that, despite using the exact same customer care number provided, I was in the wrong department, and that I was to transfer to cancellation. Compared to the time taken to wait, the call had only lasted for around half a minute - the servicers are suddenly devoted to getting rid of us, despite the fact that they work there.The next hour and two thirds had passed. When the silly Christmas background noise had ended, I was finally happy. Ironic. I then had a chat with one of the service members about the cancellation, who then quickly dropped me off at a manager after arrogantly and self-importantly talking to me as if I were some sort of baby. Can a baby wait for 3 hours, without crying?Somehow, I had arrived at my final destination, in which the manager had ridded me of my order, but still proposed to charge me for my contract an extra 67p.In conclusion, I would have added some more of my back-and-forth mishaps of Vodafone. Overall, don't waste your valuable time - rely on us who have learnt this the hard way. But to improve, I would suggest to add more in service, and teach them manners - and possibly improve everything else.",jamal,2021,12,17,1,0.062,0.077,Positive

225,Shame I can't give them zero,Avoid. Take a broadband/phone contract with this company at your peril!When your contract ends they delete your account so it may be impossible to resolve  any issues. Unless you have saved your account number somewhere (you can't login to retrieve it) customer services cannot access your details because phone number and postcode lookups by customer services don't work. Doesn't stop them taking a direct debit payment though.Just come off a call that took over an hour to resolve an overcharge which on 2 previous occasions I had been assured would not happen. Still not satisfied but I have no means of verifying whether the refund amount is correct.Unless you want to be ripped off avoid this company. Shame on you for deleting account information when the contract ends and then billing that account. What are you afraid of?And in reply to Vodafone. Just tried to login and my account is still marked as inactive. Which means that unless you have saved your customer number somewhere neither you OR Vodafone support can access your account.

Could not manage to get a new connection booked. nearly 5 hours on the phone over various dates and eventually managed to cancel the order.Vodafone tried to avoid cancelling my order as I couldn’t seem to pass the extra level of security to do so. No email services at all they would only deal with me over the phone whis is incredibly time consuming as described above. Absolute nightmare and waste of time.

231,AVOID VODAFONE.,"AVOID VODAFONE.Had an empty box delivered instead of a phone. Either Vodafone, or DPD, have stolen the device and will not help me any further.Speaking to their customer services is like speaking to brainless robots, they do not empathise, nor merely act like they're willing to help. They lie about devices being sent out, investigations taking place and still expect you to pay for a contract that is finishing in 2 weeks. This company is run on a fallacy, I do not want compensating, all I want is a resolution or, a working phone. Better yet, I'd like them to cancel my contract as its pedantry they're under the impression that I'd stay with them after this.Oversell and under deliver, promise phone calls back that NEVER happen, heartless, brain dead staff that quote ""I understand"" when they really don't. Unbelievable, embarrassing and completely unfathomable. How hard is it to track a device by its IMI number which vodaphone clearly didn't put down on the order when sending out the device.The staff have no idea what's going on, clearly communication is an issue as they ask me the same questions on numerous times I've called. I spend more time on hold then speaking to an agent.Joke of a company. They're not getting another penny out of me once my final bill comes up. Its not my problem thier warehouse system runs on windows 98.

232,Dishonest crappy company which openly lies to their loyal customers,"Being a customer for 17 years now, they are gone from some how good at the time to worst and worst. Many time over the years their pathetic sales team (which doesn’t have and knowledge of sales other than lying) tried to tricked me by telling I am a platinum customer and have so many offers. But always end up paying more than what I have promised. If you ever call there sales team and ask what they can offer they will start with how many years I have been with Vodafone and the great offers then offer me.. but those crooks never think that we have access to their web site as well.. talking hours and the end they offer the same price plan which they advertised on their web site. Not a penny less.. if you compare their plans all of them are mostly expensive than any other companies. And they secretly taken off most of the benefits as an example, Vodafone anymore doesn’t have internet access in London tubes. Even this crappy company is trying to cheat their loyalty schemes to frontline workers. If you check properly other companies give 20% off from the monthly tariff. But this Vodafone crooks playing a smart game on that by advertising two tariffs. One for the phone and one for the service. So their 20% is advertised as discounted from all the service plans. When where you get £15 discount pm in other leading mobile companies for the same phone same data amount you get around £6/ pm discount from Vodafone. Just stay away from them..Anyway when you see the stats all over the past years, pretty sure soon they will disappear.",chami69,2021,12,16,1,0.068,0.094,Positive

After a week, we had heard nothing from Vodafone and the trackers hadn't arrived so we used the online chat facility and were told it would be arriving by the end of the week. Another week passed and still no communication or our order. Again contacted customer service and were told it would arrive by the end of the week and nothing. We are going on almost 4 weeks now and have still had no luck after multiple calls to the call center and attempting to escalate  it. We have been told multiple times that it has been sent to DPD and then when asking for a tracking number, this can't be provided. Numerous times we have been told we would receive a call back by close of business with an update and no one calls. If the trackers don't arrive by the end of this week we are going to have to order from another company at an additional cost of £80. Had we ordered from them in the first place on their Black Friday sale it would only have cost us £40.The customer service at Vodafone is terrible, not once were we contacted and told there was a delay with our order, the only communication we have had is the communication we initiated through the call center or online chat.

241,If there's final bill to pay they won't contact you but charge you extra instead,"I signed 2 year contract with new mobile phone with them and at the end of it I moved to Virgin Mobile. All went smooth, I cancelled direct debit as I always do to avoid overpayments - otherwise it will be pain in the neck to get my money back. I expected final bill from them but it never arrived (no email, txt message, call or letter from them) so I presumed I overpaid and they owed me little money -  I wasn't bothered to chase that. (Other companies I had contract with always sent final bill or contacted me about it.)3 months later I was shocked when debt collector company contacted me informing there is unpaid bill for Vodafone. It was orginally £24 but due to not being paid in time it has rised to £45 including debt collector fee!!!Vodafone didn't let me know about the bill, no email, no txt message, no post! They didn't give me a chance to pay this bill as I didn't even know it exists! Instead they added to my bill £5 every month for late payment and after 3 months sold that debt to debt collector company who contacted me straight away by email, txt and post! I don't have to mention it had impact on my credit score too! Edit: (after VODAFONE reply): I'm not even able to login to see my bills as I'm not customer anymore! You don't give a  chance to pay that bill. Shame on you! Edit 2: I reported this to CISAS (through Ombudsman) and I got this bill cleared and received £50 as compensation along with apology from Vodafone.

Phoned for an upgrade and was offered a watch as part of the deal.When I got the paperwork I noticed the agent had put through the wrong handset so called them back. Was on hold for 90 minutes only to be told they couldn't amend tje order so it was have to be cancelled and a new one placed which took over an hour. After nearly 2 weeks the watch arrived but no phone and I noticed the watch had been allocated to a different number on my account incorrectly. Another 2 hours on the phone to them only to be told that the mistake with the watch cannot be corrected until the phone is delivered which may take another week! And during the call I was told I was being ""unprofessional"" because I complained about being placed on gold for 20 minutes at a time during the call.

After 2 hours of too and froing, I was told not possible to cancel by chat, you need to  phone this number. Phoned number. Spoke to Mark (lovely chap) after 40 mins he said they had issues with DPD and the phone was ""somewhere"" in a warehouse in a crate in a queue for dispatch. However, he didn't know where and he wasn't allowed to cancel the contract. I insisted and he passed me to the lovely Ian who was my  conflict resolution manager. Agreed with me completely and said ""No, you cant cancel your order"". Really, consumer rights act, not despatched, 14 days and all that stuff and the page displayed on the vodafone uk website explaining that regardless of any conflict this page take precedence, and you still wont cancel it for me Ian? ""Sorry sir, you have misunderstood me, I am not refusing to cancel your order, I am simply unable to cancel it for you"". I will escalate your unhappiness to our corporate division. They will be in touch within 72 hours to discuss your situation. 5 days ago and not so much as a call from anyone, let alone corporate - maybe they ordered their phone from Vodafone uk, in which case I may never hear from them. So, no phone, wont cancel it for me, wont return my £600, no idea where the phone is, no idea when it might be despatched and no idea in general really! Look at the Vodafone Facebook page. Click on the very first post on the page and view the comments, there are hundreds of people in this exact position venting their unhappiness and getting nowhere. If this is the same as you, contact Ofcom through their website.

I did no chat transcript in my email.I did recieve an email from cancellations telling me if there is anything they can do to help to call. I did today had to wait 15 mins for a adviser then through security questions told her everything that had happened and how disappointed I am. I then asked why I have not recieved a copy of my transcript .she asked me to go on hold which I did while she spoke to her supervisor. She came back after some minutes and said I have to call complaints and asked if I wanted the number.I could not believe what I was hearing I asked if she could get them to call me as I am at work and reminded her the time I spent yesterday 1 hour 15mins and 20 minutes today plus she said she is not in that department but clearly in there email they say if they got something wrong they will try to put right. Not Vodafone waste of time really I would not recommend any person taking a contract with Vodafone.I have always paid my bills never missed a month hardly use most of my data Vodafone you use to be Top now I'm afraid you have slipped miserable to bottomAfter my experience I feel drained not important and especially not a valued Vodafone customer.I do hope some one from the dedicated Vodafone tea. Read this atrocious customer serviceI have given 1 star for good connectionThank youBut no Thank you PeterIn response to the reply from Vodafone.have you tried taking your 30 day notice away. Surely if you have a 24 month contract  you know and the customer knows. Not all people have the date end or 30 days prior on their mind 24 months later , I think what would be fair is to contact the customer 30 days prior and remind them give them a chance not to be penalised by having to pay further monies. I paid all the monies on time every month I honoured my contract.  Even more puzzling when your customer calls you to tell you they want to start a new contract and for the one about to expire not to continue  and you do not seem interested to keep that customer then its no wonder Vodafone ratings are so poor.Part of my monthly fees are for the customer service I probably called 3 times in 24 months and that would be on the mobile and broadband contract combined .Even after all I have told you Vodafone still expects me to now contact you again via face book ??Vodafone are you for real ?I will pay the 30 day money for something j have no intention of using purely because the sooner I can escape from having to pay any further monies to a company that does not care or respect there genuine customers.Please do not waste any more of my time My review is about very poor customer service from Vodafone and your response just sums it all upThank youPeter",Peter Brown,2021,12,7,1,0.086,0.074,Negative

330,I have been an O2 and Virgin customer…,"I have been an O2 and Virgin customer for years but luckily for me CityFibre installed their infrastructure on my street a few months ago and I was able to order Gigabit internet from a few suppliers, including Vodafone.1. INSTALLATIONInstallation is done by CityFiber (CF), so if something goes wrong, blame them. My installation went without any problems however CF couldn't perform a speed test and they left me without working internet and told me to contact Vodafone. I believe it is CF fault as they lost first OTP (black box with fibre connected to it) and they had to install another one which hasn't been provisioned or something. 2. DELIVERYI could complain a bit about delivery, the modem was delivered on the installation day but I was told it will be delivered a few days before the installation day. Another issue is that my order contained a Hub, USB dongle as a backup, SIM, WiFi6 with extender. But on the installation day I received only a Hub and SIM and there was a leaflet in the box saying that I should have everything in the box. I was a bit worried about this but I had to contact support anyway.3. SUPPORTOMG, I haven't seen such friendly and professional support for years. I used chat to contact them (in the chat with TOBI bot just write: live person). I was told that the Internet will start to work after midnight (it started to work in about an hour after I closed the chat. I was told that the dongle and extender will be delivered to me soon, but it was delivered the next day. I asked about static IP and modem mode and got answers to that too.4. EXTRASWhen I placed my order there was a 50GB dongle on the offer, which you connect to the router and it is a backup in case of any failure (I was told that it will renew once used up). You can request static IP free of charge. You can ask support for the PPPoE login which allows you to configure your own router with PPPoE support.5.SPEEDSA. Probably you won't get 1gbps on your WiFi device.B. Make sure that you use at least CAT.5E cable.C. Various speed tests did not work for me, they vary a lot. I couldn't go above 450Mbps in Firefox, Chrome gave me better results but around 800Mbps max. And then I found a PRO Speed Test backed by a Polish government to allow people measure and even certify their measurement! It is available here pro.speedtest.pl . Language on their site can be changed to English. You have to register an account, download the Windows/Mac app, and on the website under the Apps tab you will find a ""token"" which you have to enter in the app to start the measurement. That gave me brilliant and clear results!D. I got from 900mbps to 935mbps on upload and download and it is pretty stable!6. CONCLUSIONAt this stage I'm very happy, I got something 3x faster than Virgin for half of the price (30 quid for 24 months). I also hope that all of the above make sense to you guys and based on my review you will be able to make a decision whether it is worth it or not.",Emil O,2021,12,7,5,0.048,0.101,Positive

Next day I was assured of delivery within 48 hours and then over the rest of weeks I was promised the phone will be with me in next n number of hours.Then reasons given for delay were every lie under the sun, ranging from courier not picking up the parcel, to Black fridays sales etc etc and eventually they guy on the customer service owned up and said ""my friend to be honest I don't know when you gonna get your phone""Since It's more than two weeks now and I eventually visited local vodafone store, where another con artist said you can get phone in 3-5 working days if you sign up today, I said to him how is it possible if phone two weeks ago hasn't arrived yet and you claiming to deliver the phone in 5 days.And then he made up excuse on the go, oh didn't you hear about flooding in the warehouse, your phone is probably one the boxes water damaged and Apple is replacing themThis is now 3rd or 4th time they have treated me in dodgy way (previous couple of years incident were ort authorisation, Vodafone taking money from my account for the non existent broadband service etc etc. It almos seems the staff's attitude is "" just handover their money and don't expect service, but we will spin you yarns"" And would you believe the sales guy said hey look at the bright side, you are saving money as Vodafone is not charging you for the new phone until its dispatched..............seriously I think Vodafone can do with losing some customers, I will be taking my business elsewhere next time.",Jay Chandel,2021,12,6,1,0.038,0.053,Positive

342,Absolutely appalling,"I honestly think that joining Vodafone was the worst mistake of my life.The people they hire for customer support are unhelpful, keep you on the phone for 30-40 minutes repeating the same boring script without doing absolutely nothing. I've been a broadband customer since September and not even for a single day my internet worked properly, dropping 40-50 times a day. I called so many times about this, had engineers in my house, done all sort of troubleshooting and still nothing.On one occasion, the customer care agent, because of revenge or by mistake (I think) that I asked her to hurry because I needed to get to work (after 45 mins of doing absolutely nothing for me) somehow stopped all my mobile services. I could not do anything, call anyone, my SIM was simply ""Not registered on the network"" even though the issue I called about was about broadband !! After about 6 hours I managed to find an almost competent customer agent which I called from another phone and he was able to re-activate my services. He kept saying it was a network glitch but I think it's too much of a coincidence.This kind of revenge, if it was truly revenge, is not to be tolerated and I think it's an abuse.. I could have been in a life or death situation without being able to call anyone. Not to mention that day I missed a very important call from my bank.I am writing this as I am once again on a phone call with another useless customer care agent who can barely speak any English. Most of the times I can hear background noises, construction workers or even babies. I can barely understand what they are saying. The people they hire are in my opinion useless: they keep you on the phone for 30-40 minutes on average, reading a script and not thinking. These people are not allowed to think, just follow the script. I believe I have wasted around 8-9 hours of my life in total with all the phone calls I made to their customer support.At the end of the day all I want is to end it with them. Just cancel this curse of a broadband contract and that's it. Never ever in my life I would choose Vodafone again.If you read this, pleas think twice before joining them and also read the other reviews here.",Rosu Alin,2021,12,6,1,0.115,0.05,Negative

Submitted an official complaint which they said would get back to me in 5 days and now its day 8. Can't get through on phone and webchat agent disappeared and no new one assigned. Horrible customer service. Never choose Vodafone, your nerve cells are not worth it!Edit: now Vodafone commented here for me to go to social media to discuss about my horrendous experience. I added my account number when making this review for their ease of locating my account, and it seems they have ignored the fact that my official complaint is still without a reply.

350,Trust that trustpilot score,"After arriving in the UK from NZ I joined Vodafone because I wanted a solid provider, since I'd be depending on my phone for Internet. I should have checked their trustpilot score first!The first issue was (and at last check still is) that topping up is partly broken. Trying to do it through the website portal often gives inscrutable errors - it seems to only accept certain amounts. After struggling with that for a while I went to the store to top up and they said, yep, it's a known issue people have been having for a while... you'd think a company would want to make sure their customers can pay them but 3 months later it's still patchy.The second issue is that coverage quality is pretty poor. Even in main centres around Cambridge, it's rare to get 4G, often only 2G. Coverage is better than that in little old NZ!Now we've moved to Ely and, in our rental, getting any kind of reception at all is spotty. This is in spite of having checked Vodafone's coverage map before moving to make sure we'd get OK data - which claimed we should get at least 3G indoors.Not true. Calls drop out in some rooms. Mobile data is only available outside or by one of two windows - and even then only intermittently and at &lt; 1 Mpbs. Nor is it just our house - which is in the town proper after all - walking around we find the same thing in many places around the town. The other day I tried to message my wife from inside Aldi and noticed I had no reception at all.On this basis I'd strongly advise holding off on signing up for a long contract until you're sure you'll actually get service!In short, it's hard to pay them, and when you finally do, it's hard to get what you paid for.",Russel,2021,12,5,2,0.077,0.107,Positive

358,Disgusting treatment,"Dear Sirs,In the absence of your company allowing any opportunity to submit a written complaint, instead opting for individuals handing out £40 by default on a customer services line thinking that a small cash donation will solve every problem, I have chosen to write to you all in the hope that someone will respond, and I will continue to share my experience and write on every platform until I get the satisfaction from my miss-treatment at the hands of your company.I have been a customer for 21yrs and last month wondered into my local store with £1000 in my pocket looking to buy a new handset. (Epsom, Surrey UK) i was told by ISHAQ that they don't sell handsets and would have to take my business elsewhere. So Argos got my £900 for a new Samsung handset. I returned to the store announcing that my plan had ended and that I wanted to by a sim only deal at £10 as opposed to my previous £40 plan. This was undertaken by ISHAQ and I was firmly told that I would have to do nothing else, he reassured me that my direct debit would not change and everything would carry on as normal. May I just say that since leaving the shop and starting my new number and plan a direct debit had come from my account and i felt that everything was running smooth. Fast forward on to today 4/12/2021. at 9am i open a letter from Vodafone telling me that my account ref 7045319361 has been passed to Ardent Collection agency for ""Debt Collection"" which will now ""Make it difficult for me to obtain future credit for loans and other phone contracts"".I ring 191, the automated service will not allow me to proceed with my call, stating that my account is in debit and until the amount is paid then i can't go any further. When you select to pay, the recorded message states ""YOUR BALANCE IS ZERO""I take the letter and attend my local Epsom Store and pointed out my complaint and distress. All 3 joined in at one point or another, Sarah gave me the most input but instead of being apologetic about the issue decided to lecture me like an infant about the ineptitude of Vodafone, I must point out I am a 50yr old Clinical Professional and am disgusted with the communication style and complete disregard for any empathy on my behalf, holding me to ransom for £25 which had accrued due to Vodafone not making a request to my bank via the direct debit which was already in place and instead went straight to a collection agency.its now 3pm and i am typing this having been on hold to a member of your team on 191 for 38mins. This is utterly disgusting treatment to one of your many loyal customers who uses your services which lets you all at the top of the tree live the lives that you are accustom to,I want a full apology, compensation for 5hrs of my time and distress, I also want feedback from the line Manager of ""Sarah"" that she learns the skillset to communicate with Customers and represent your Brand,",John Manning,2021,12,4,1,0.059,0.056,Negative

Given what has followed I count myself lucky to have managed to do that, but can I squeeze the money they took for the hub they never delivered out of them? No, even though they messaged me to say I must ring them to claim my refund, when I do so I “fail security” apparently because I am getting my own d.o.b. wrong. Lol. Though they try to gaslight, I know it is their doing as I have passed security many times before with my actual d.o.b. - in fact every time  they cold-transferred me to another operative, which was frequently. So under their procedures, made up by them, incompetently performed and untruthfully defended as being “necessary for GDPR”, they get to keep the cash they are aware they owe me - convenient.

Overall, Ive been lied to probably around 6/7 times and I still dont know when I am going to get the order. This is ridiculous. As a large company, how can you not know what orders will go out on what date? All i keep getting told is false information and that DPD will let me know when my order is dispatched.

381,Black Friday deal 19th November,Black Friday deal 19th November  - Gigafast 900 extra for £34 a month. A bargain!!! I am currently paying for my dads home broadband which is out of contract for £28 for 36gb. When I saw the deal I instantly thought I needed it too. On the phone to Vodafone and got a second line to my home address and ordered. Also got a discount as a second line and got it for £28 a month. Upgraded the existing line also for £34 a month. Total £66 a month. Then all the problems started. My order confirmation informed me all the equipment would be sent to my old address. I obviously informed Vodafone who said no problem we will cancel the order and replace it as redirecting would not be possible. I didn’t complain as long as I got internet. I did express obviously the discounts I received and was assured they would be applied.On the 22nd November I got a call informing me My original line could not be installed due to city fibre not completing their work. (Install date 8th dec) I got a call informing me this order would be cancelled. No problem at least I still had a new line looking to be installed on the 20th dec. then for some reason both my lines were cancelled on 22nd and then again a reorder had to be placed. The reason city fiber couldn’t install at my new address but after Vodafone checked with city fibre and it was good to go. Once again I expressed to them I would like them to apply the discount I was given when I applied.1st December I got a call from Vodafone to find out why I had left??? Clearly I was shocked but the guy had managed to reorder and I expressed I would like for them to honour the Black Friday deal I received when I took out the package and they said no problem. Got my new bill and not only is it more but they are now refusing to honour the deal which I was given. They said because I didn’t upgrade my original line they could not honour the discount I was given. I had expressed I am happy to upgrade my existing line to ensure I get the discount but they would not apply the discount. Absolutely terrible. When I got to their retentions team they informed me to make a complaint. They couldn’t resolve my issue over the phone and have me a premium rate number to call. This is so someone could go though the voice calls to confirm I am not lying about the offer despite having an email confirming pricing which was explained to Vodafone. When I have tried calling Vodafone complaint team I got through to Amrik who had informed me as it was home broadband he could not deal with the issue and put me through the reluctant department. I have been on the phone since 18.30 tonight and still on hold without any success. I would strongly recommend anyone to stay away from Vodafone.

They were rude and unhelpful with 1 agent keeping me on the phone for 1 hour and to tell me he wont help me as i cannot receive text messages to get a security code. I told him thats not my fault as you havent ported my number over yet. He then after 1 hour said he can further security check me with questions. To then tell me after all this he cant help me!! I told him i want to complain and he told me i cannot complain and vodafone are not taking complaints. I told him its illegal to not have a complaint procedure and to refuse someone to complain he just said they wont take complaints ans he cannot help me he also shouted at me on phone!I called back and spoke to someone else. After 40 minutes they then told me there was a tech issue and i have to wait another 48 hours!! I was fuming as i cant reveive calls or text and they promised it would definitely be sorted in another 48 hrs.After this time went again nothing the number not ported properly i can call and text but cannot receive any calls or texts.I have called the customer service team a total of 15 times!! With everyone lying and fobbbing me off. I have called again and the guy said he will speak to the tech team to sort it. He came back and said i need to turn phone off and on i told him i do this all the time it doesnt work he promised it would and said he would call me to check i told him what happens if doesnt work you cannot call me as ive explained. He took my lanline and said he would call that. He never called me backhe also lied and fobbed me off im constantly calling and no one is helping im just getting lies and fobbed off. The port has gone wrong and wont allow me to now get calls. The phone calls i have made to customer service need to be checked its horrendous what ive been put through constantly lied to not helped people fob you off to get you off phone and im told on a recorded call they wont take complaints and no managed will call!!!Recently again been in phone and told the inbound numbers were barred as a trouble shoot and should habe been taken off but were not!! However this still didnt work and still not getting calls and texts i was told the back office team of tesco were contscted to make sure all files were ported and to wait 48 hours to then later today get told they wernt contacted and now an agent will email them and i have to again wait 3 days!! Then call them again and if doesnt work they will run more tests. Its a week without my number working now and have to wait another 3 days no one calls back no one helps everyone lies.Ive lost loads of business and my sick parents cannot contact me on my number due to this. Im sick woth worry and have been in tears over it yet again vodafone dont care. Every call is recorded and i will take serious action against vodafone due to this.Do not go with them they are horrific company. The agents always promise they have given info to person they transfer you to but NEVER DO AND HAVE TO GO THROUGH VERIFICATION EVERY TIMEI need to received tests and calls i even gave them another number to call me back on when everyone promised they would but never do.Ive spent about 9 hours on phone to them and spoke to about 20 different agents now.

413,Do not honour their own promotions,"Vodafone messed up their own Black Friday Samsung S21 deal. Their website claimed you could buy a 128MB Samsung S21 in-store for £353. Yet, nearly all London stores were refusing to honour it, unaware of it or conveniently out of stock. I spoke to Vodafone advisor over Facebook for hours who said you couldn't do it online, but was adamant you could pay £249 up front (this was correct), take out a 12 month contract, then ring up and pay the rest of the phone off, switch to a 30 day rolling contract and then cancel that. Yet, when I rang the Sale steam, they contradicted this and said I could not switch contract once paying the phone off and could only do this after 12 months.

414,Avoid Vodafone Broadband,"My broadband has gone live today and I have no router and have been told they hope to deliver by the end of the week. An absolute joke made worse by the fact that previous call to customer service they ensured me it would be delivered the day I was taking to them (one tried to claim it was out delivery). They were just saying anything as nobody seems to have a clue what's going on. The agent today finally admitted there was an issue and claimed it was to do with the warehouse updating their systems which did not sound convincing at all. There seems to be no urgency from them and there is no one who really seems to know what's going on with this issue. Massively regret moving to them and anyone who is considering doing so due to cheap special offers should definitely think twice. There is a reason they are rated so badly, the broadband side of their business is an absolute mess that can't fulfil the most basic obligations allied with dishonest and excruciatingly slow customer service.

418,"False Promises, False Solutions, True Regret","I spent four separate days with customer service via chat (2x) and phone (2x) because my account does not reflect my purchased data package. One of the phone agents told me that when you buy the 90-day 15GB data broadband option for 25GBP, only 6GB shows up on the account. Call them when it runs out, and they will add 6GB more and 6GB more again after that runs out. That makes ZERO sense. I paid for 15GB, so why does your ""system"" not work the way it should? Why do chat AND phone customer service tell me they ""added"" the correct plan for it not to be there? This business practice is shady at best. Chat has an option to email yourself the conversation transcript, but it does not work. I can't even save my chat transcript as evidence of malicious practice for a credit card dispute. Screenshots work, but one page with all the chat data is more helpful for the user/customer. If I end up going to my credit card bank, I can't wait to hear their thoughts on the screenshots of my chat transcript. Y'all make telecoms in the United States look far better than they deserve.I use AT&T in the USA (I'm an American studying abroad in the UK), and their fishy practices are more apparent and resolvable compared to the sketch-fest I've seen here in the UK with Vodafone Broadband.

429,Avoid like the plague!!,"This review is about the ""service"" you are likely to receive should anything go wrong or you want to leave Vodafone. I decided to leave and requested my unlock code so I could use the phone I spent the last 18 months paying nearly £60 a month for on a different network. After a very very long time spent on online chats and phone calls with advisors who couldn't understand what I was saying and kept disconnecting me, it turned out they didn't have a copy of the unlock code and had to request it from the manufacturer. This would take 10 working days apparently. 8 working days later I received an email from Carl at Vodafone telling me that my phone wasn't locked and to just insert a non Vodafone Sim. Now why didn't I think of this myself?? Of course I did, not being a complete idiot. This was the reason I was requesting an unlock code in the first place. So the whole ordeal starts again, I try to complain, i'm ignored, I speak to people who are clearly not listening and fobbing me off with a script they read from, i'm reassured again that this time, just like they said last time, the request had been submitted and now it would be another 10 working days. Well you probably guessed it. It's 10 working days later and no sign of the unlock code. I try to complain, no advisors available, they recommend I fill out their online form which just opens up an error message typically and I've been forced to pay for an unlock code from a phone shop which still hasn't arrived either. I don't know how many phone calls i've missed, i'm expecting MRI results, I can't log in to important things that require two factor authentication, I would steer clear of Vodafone at all costs.

First their credit check wouldn't work because my address did not have a number in it but a house name. 4hrs lost on two calls (one person deliberately disconnected me after an hour) before finally getting someone who knew how to work their cr@p systems. Ridiculous they credit checked me anyway as I am now paying loads less than I was a month ago. Never missed a D/D payment since the start in 1999. So finally ordered a data only sim, which two separate people and an email promised would be next day delivery. It has now been 3 days and it is still not even dispatched. The latest fool I spoke to there said they had major warehouse issues and it would be 2-3 days. Times is up, where is the damn sim? All Vodafone have done is lie, lie, lie. Hours on the phone to incompetent customer services people, some who struggle with the language, working from home on very very slow systems has shown me the company has lost the plot totally. Their buggy software has never been worse and I just don't know where I am with these clowns as nobody has a clue what is going on. Is anyone else here suffering from delays on products that were promised the next day and that simply have not been sent? Changing subject, are you a Vodafone shareholder? Sell up now.

I have been with Vodafone for almost 13 years.Its always an hassle when it's come to upgrade. Even though they have best plan available they won't give you one. However the scenario is total different recently when I tried to upgrade. Day 1 - Cust Adv 1:I called them for an upgrade for brand new phone. She took almost 15 min take all info including nature of plan etc. even though I have clearly mentioned whats the requirements was. Took another 50 min to come back with a plan which is more expensive than even on their on portal. When asked she said she can only give that plan (after applying all discounts etc) but tried to reduce the bundled data to match my requirement which I denied.Day 2:  Cust adv 2 - when contacted he took around 20 min to match a plan much cheaper than online with a discount..I was happy and proceeded with order. Told he need to do a hard credit check for Device which is new norm in VF now when there is a device upgrade. so I obliged and he did so and sent a device agreement to email to approve. There he did a mistake that this device can only opened with my Previous address. So I got confused and wanted to confirm if the delivery address is my current address or not. So called the next executive. Cust Adv 3: Patiently heard my request and put me on hod for 30 min and came back and said she has to cancel the order, needs to do soft credit check again and has to rebuild the order. Took another 50 min came back and said address is sorted and she has rebuilt the order too. When I asked for the order details it was without the discount. When I told about the plan details which I got previously, she argued that was the plan I ordered and can't apply any discounts as its all gone now. its already took another 30 min.. I being spent 2 hours, having my discounted  order cancelled and a new order without the discounts for mistakes done from their end and spending valuable 3 hours over the phone was so frustrating. Then I disconnected the call. She gave me complaint number too do complaint. Cust Adv 3 - Contacted them to get the PAC code. Retention Adv: Did offer to match a online plan but with another hard credit check which I denied. If wasn't careful they would hv messed up my credit history too..

My credit rating is as good as anybody’s and higher now than when I took out previous phones. What makes me laugh is, Vodafone have said that I’m approved to add an additional line. I can only assume that they stood to lose on my upgrade as it was only a slight increase in my monthly payments from my sim only plan. So they have said my credit rating isn’t good enough for a £3 a month increase, yet will give me an additional line at £25 a month increase! Go figure!!! Just a complete scam!

Their flimsy excuse - some third parties had used their brand to create that promotion. When I made clear this was on ITV, on the Martin Lewis show, their excuses became even more bizarre!

455,Don't buy from Vodafone!!!,"I went into the Glasgow store to try and buy a Google pixel 6 as the website stated that you can't buy the phone outright on the website. Once in store I was told that you couldn't actually buy the phone outright at all. That I had to buy the phone on finance and with an air time plan. (Which I didn't want to do as I already have a decent SIM contract) I was told nothing was possible and was essentially turned away. The reason this was incredibly frustrating is my cousin had just bought the same phone outright in a store in Bradford. So I was pretty annoyed I couldn't do the same. I contacted customer service via chat and phone. I couldn't get through on the phone at all, even after an hour and 45 wait. The chat bot was useless kept asking the same questions even when I asked to speak to an advisor. I finally got through to customer service and they couldn't do anything, they couldn't explain why the store in Glasgow wouldn't sell the phone or offer any advice. I ended up going to another store in the Fort, calling in advance and even then I ended up having to buy the phone on a payment plan and buy a sim and pay for a months contract before I could cancel it. So ended up buying the phone in such a stupid long winded way, having to set up finance (to just pay off straight away) and setting up a SIM contract (which I didn't need or want and spent an extra £19 on) AND to top it all off I'm still waiting to get an email from Google to order my free Google Stadia Premiere Edition.

466,Very Poor Customer Service,"We have Vodafone Home Broadband. The past couple of years it has been average at best - nothing to write home about, but not terrible either. Whenever we have contacted their Customer Service it has been terrible. Whether by phone or chat it has been an extremely time-consuming and difficult task to get things sorted.The latest fiasco has been trying to get the service moved over to our new house (because we are in contract and would need to pay a ridiculous amount to cancel it)... but now I'm thinking it would have been a better use of time to pay the fee and get another Broadband provider sorted at the new house(!).The 2 phone calls I had were both gentlemen with questionable English and would barely let me finish a sentence. From blaming a long wait for activation on CityFibre needing to do some work, to finding out there is no work to be carried out other than the install/activation (in a later conversation), I'm not best pleased.After these calls, I opted to use the chat instead (mainly so I get a copy of the transcript as evidence of the conversation for future reference should I need to dispute anything). In a bid to provide quick replies, the team member's messages were filled with typos and mistakes which caused a LOT of confusion. They were also convinced we were on a higher package than we actually are. I don't know where that came from, but all our documentation/account info/bills state the package we are on, but they thought we upgraded to a higher package (and then said we'd need to pay more if we want to stay on the higher performance package). I honestly couldn't be much more displeased with the chat and how much time it took to get to a resolution.Having previously worked in Customer Service myself, I would be ashamed of these interactions if I were the employee. And I'm pretty sure management would have had words with me too.The ONLY up-side is we've got £1.50 per month off our bill for the remaining 18 months (score!).We are highly likely to change providers at the end of this contract.I chose to ignore reviews like this when we decided to move over to Vodafone (primary factor in the decision was to save money compared to our old provider while my husband studied).

471,AVOID Vodafone If you value your peace of mind,"I've had intermittent service for the past year, it has deteriorated dramatically in the past 2 months.I have call recordings of agents giving 5 different reasons for the issue, and 8 different times/dates for when the local cell tower will be fixed.It appears the customer service agents deliberately lie just to get you off the phone.I've asked for a callback from a manager 3 times, since I can't believe anything the customer service agents say anymore, not once has a manager called.I've completely lost trust in this awful company. Finally had enough and signed up to a different provider, it's just not worth the headache, & not possible for any other company to be as bad as this.Obviously no company is perfect, but just take a look at the reviews around the Web, Vodafone really is as bad as people say.Update:I still don't know the cause, but I've now been advised the cell tower will be fixed 17th Dec (work started 10 Sept) in London 2021 it takes 4 months to fix a fault. I eventually received a callback from a 'customer resolution team' supervisor, who wasn't much better than the agents, after making a monetary offer as compensation, which I thanked him for & accepted, but when I politely asked to speak to someone more senior since I wasn't getting the answers to my questions, his tone changed and told me he has revoked the offer. I asked why is he being spiteful, he tried to gaslight me into believing I didn't give him the chance to explain that if I didn't accept the offer and close the complaint he would revoke it. Unfortunately for him I record all calls & asked him to call me back once I'd listened back. Long story shortened, he had plenty of opportunity to speak, I decided to accept, I'd rather take the offer since I'm not getting quality service.I'm not going to contact anyone else, I tried unsuccessfully to find just one person who could give an honest answer about the issue. I strongly believe the agents would not be as poor as they are if they felt there would be consequences, the rot must be coming from the top.I remember when I worked in CS in my college years, quality of service was drilled into us from day one.You don't get the impression this happens at Vodafone, because if quality was important, there wouldn't have been so much misinformation.Whoever you are that asked me to get in touch, thank you, but no thanks, that road leads to madness. If you genuinely wanted to assist, I'm sure you could find my account details from the info I've shared here.Update:Yet another promised date to fix the issue has come and gone with no end in sight to resolve the poor network.

The initial email confirmed the start date but shortly afterwards things started to go downhill. Firstly I received my first bill on the 26th Sept then the following day my router arrived. This should have arrived 3 days before the start date. Then I received a message saying that my service had started. At this stage I decided to check the reviews. I couldn't believe how bad they were and as a consequence I cancelled my contract within the 14 days and I received an email confirming cancellation and that no fees were due.I cancelled my direct debit as a precaution.I then went on holiday thinking that all was sorted but while I was away I received a second bill. Things were to get worse as just after I arrived home I received a letter from a debt recovery company demanding payment for the first bill. I had two issues the first being that I didn't owe anything and second why didn't they send a communication to say that they had been unable to take the money from my bank.Now started the sorry saga of trying to speak to someone to sort things out. Hours of press this button for this and another for that and twice when I heard the sound of someones voice I was immediately cut off. I eventually found a alternate number for complaints and that was answered in reasonable time but it still took 40 minutes to get the result I wanted.

Did that twice for it to not connect and they still didn’t know what else to do. One of the guys had said “the reason it’s so difficult to get through is to prevent calls coming through” which is appalling if you need to speak to someone and which now they won’t give me a refund because I am now out of the 14days period.

They insisted they had no alternative despite settling account and explanations and hours spent on the phone. Impossible to contact through Covid and worst mobile experience ever. Still fighting them a year later. After a battle through CICAS they proved I had a late payment of £23 WOW which I settled as soon as I became aware. They offered me £250 and an apology but refused to amend my credit file. Best of it they disclosed my notes which stated —- instruction to staff “Please do not discuss or action anything on the account relating to the customers complaint which is regarding credit file impact. Please Note you can discuss unrelated issues that the customer has and if the customer calls to make a payment Whatever the complaint reason you can take it !!!!!!! Failure to comply with this result in action being taken in line with the performance matrix” Irony being this was even after the account was settled so they were wasting my time all along.

In the end i’ve had to waste my time moving my number to a different network and then back to Vodafone, which took about a week (they tried to scare me away from doing this by saying it would take 60 days). I had to do all of this because they are too stubborn to offer loyal customers the same deal as new customers. If they really can’t switch numbers, then all they had to do was offer me a price match, but they refused to do that and instead made me waste my time swapping my phone number between networks.

557,One star is too high.,"One star is too high.All we have had since switching our broadband service to Vodafone is a service that will last for a couple of hours in a day at best, or more frequently no service at all. This was initially reported in the last week of August and we are still facing exactly the same problems now in Mid November. What Vodafone have highlighted however is that they are very good at attempting to avoid responsibility, ensuring that customers are blocked and obstructed at every possible opportunity, have a large number of people working in their ‘top level directors complaint office’ (I know this because over the last three months we have seldom been able to speak to the same person - another demonstration of how the company structurally tries to frustrate customers making any headway is resolving issues) and telling bare faced lies - which we have started to individually highlight in emails each day they say another one - this can be in relation to calls they claim to have tried to make, to emails that we have that they pretend don’t exist - the sort of behaviour you might expect from a moody 13 year old sulking in their bedroom. In short, don’t touch Vodafone with a barge pole. In fact, don’t touch them with as many barge poles as you can find. Poor service, exceptionally poor attitude and corporately structured to lie and deceive . I wonder if they will add the meaningless platitudeI understand how important it is to stay connected.

Two weeks ago I paid off my contract £411 to then go to a sim only deal to save money. I spoke to a gentleman who was new and didn't really know what he was doing which is poor training on Vodafone behalf. Then a lady phoned me on a different number to say she was Vodafone which after phoning Vodafone to make sure it was confirmed she was. She said that the deal I had been given was not saving me money and I could keep my phone number by doing it a different way which I did. £27 a month for 120GB data, unlimited text and mins with 5G & Spotify. Which was a very good deal and I couldn't say no. After now having my sim only contract sim card, the 5G has not worked for 2 weeks. (Bearing in mind I have brought a iPhone 13 Pro Max through apple upgrade programme so my phone is compatible) One of the ladies at work has the same phone, and is with Vodafone and she gets 5G in our office and she is sat next to me!!! I do not get 5G and have not since I had the new contract. After speaking to FOUR different people through Tobi the online chat I decided to phone up Vodafone even though when trying to sort the paying off contract I was on hold for 5 Hours!!! I spoke to a gentleman which said that the 5G would work within 24-hour which then said my sim card had not been changed over from 4G - 5G. To then be told that I was in credit £336 which was not right as this was to pay off my contract which now I know hasn't been done. Maybe they were using it for staff night out? I was on the phone for 1 HOUR whilst trying to work as I did mention I was at work! Which then I asked to speak to a manager or complaints department which both gentlemen would not put me through to, they just tried to talk me down. Nothing has been resolved and I will now have to wait for a call back to see if a manager would like to come off there tea / cigarette break to talk to me. I do NOT want to be with Vodafone any more, I would like to leave. I have 14 day cooling off period which I would like to cancel my contract and be done with Vodafone which no one would help me with.

Travel not included pay extra for that. by the end of all that your paying almost £50 upfront then almost £70 a mouth but that’s 3 years when others offer £45 2 year unlimited everything. It doesn’t make clear if you can change the air time package after 2 years. I’m just so disappointed. I’ve got my broadband which is £27, a sim only £25 and my contact £52.

Problems from day 1And they are all ignoring the problem and their promises saying it's another team that needs to sort, hours on phone pillar to post. I moved entire small businesses phones after over 10 years with T Mobile EE to Vodafone business and was a complete mess from start signal and calls kept dropping and they couldn't activate wifi calling to help when at home office it took weeks and them needing to cancel my phone and re-apply wifi calling as technical support couldn't figure it out it was not done properly when I got the phone. Top of the range expensive phone as well. And the signal stated as good for my areas both at home and town are awful calls dropping etc and I rely on these 3 lines. I was promised if I stayed a bit longer to see if they could make things improve that don't worry you can leave without penalty if things don't get better we really appreciate you sticking with us to try and fix this! We appreciate you!Things were still poor signal and so said I need to leave as was promised, as sadly you can't provide a workable level of signal and service for me, now when trying to leave- 3 or 4 departments all say “it's another department it's them, not us” - each washing their hands of it and the Watford Intu store do not respond to emails either or answer calls. No manager in business customer service could or would speak to me in any department for me business customer service is a complete a joke. Also, they said that the notes they made on the system are lots but very vague and so making it difficult. Did I get it it in writing? No I trusted you listen to the calls If the notes you made are so bad. So much stress for me at an already stressful time with various health etc. They should be ashamed. Also, after verbal promises that must surely be able to listen to the calls they didn't bother after promising to.Promised calls back and nothing!! It's going nowhere just ignored now.Wrote Watford store - nothingWent to Watford store today and told sorry both managers busy upstairs.I have paid hundreds of pounds over the last couple of months for a service that does not work and they have made it sooooooooo. hard for me to leave without penalty as promised if I gave then more time.and no doubt I will have to go legal as no one comes back to you or can it will help me.It's disgusting they got my money, sold me an expensive phone and 3 lines and have washed their hands of it. Covering over their broken promises that I would have no trouble returning at no penalty if things did not improve with the signal.I should have left within the 14 days and NOT trusted them and given them an extra month or two to resolve. In my experience this is what happens when you trust them.I so wish I had read the reviews here. Business is tough enough right now and your phone is an essential tool, I can't afford to have clients not reach me or our calls drop it looks very unprofessional and can compromise my business. It can take ages to reach some contacts then the call drops!!I have spent hours on the phone trying to sort this, wasting precious time and just the same experience over and over. Also when I signed up got a confirmation email that said you can chat to us live 24/7 another completely inaccurate promise and a false bit of advertising as they are closed and only open at certain times. I can only assume they think they will get away with breaking verbal contract and promises and keeping my money for a service they can't provide well enough as promised or honouring the return when I trusted them and gave them more time. I shall continue to update this and how long it takes for them to keep their promise and refund me. In summary In my experience If you don't get good service in 14 days leave!!!!!! don't let them friendly sweet talk you into staying longer whilst they try to “fix it” then if not fixed ignore you and say it's another department back and forwards contradicting themselves over and over sorry we can't help you sorry we will call back and then nothing no messages sent or left.This is a truly awful experience I'm so disappointed and feel such a fool for trusting them. I'm a small business and this is damaging my business.

The nightmare begins 3 weeks of diagnostics and blaming Samsung also be shouted at that the option is there. Went on to see how to raise my complaint Resolve. Sent it off to repair the option still missing. Swapped for like for like guest what still missing. I took it to local store for them to open the Samsung box and set it up. They even in formed the resolve team that the option is missing. They allowed me to swap to a complete different phone. Hang on I can’t as my airtime contract has to be cancelled.

I was on an online chat, on hold via phone call and in a queue or speaking to a various range of b Vodafone  representatives for more than 4 hours. I actually ended the process in tears and came away without any resolve. I am a rational and totally calm person, I can’t believe the service brought me to tears in frustration. The staff are under pressure with high queues of people waiting to speak with them. On 2 occasions, I was placed 70th in a queue. I couldn’t even begin to list the range of shortfalls during this 4 hour period. All I suggest is, please look elsewhere for you mobile phone contract. As a loyal  customer who has payed them tens of thousands of pounds. All I can say is ‘shame on you vodaphone!’ The CEO and senior management need to know what the customers experience truthfully is like and take stock of where they what their business to be inn5 years time.

658,AWFUL!!,"Where do I start! ABSOLOUTELY HORRENDOUS!!!!Please, DO NOT contemplate Vodafone for any form of service.We have had the worst service from this company, worse than what we have experienced from any company we have ever dealt with. And it sounds like an understatement but truly, it is not. Let me explain:So, when our router was first installed at the beginning of August. We had no Internet signal whatsoever to any rooms within our house as it was placed in a location that WE SAID would not be suitable. However they did this anyway because apparently its Vodafone and they can do whatever they want because they know better than us simple minded people.So, after that installation, we finally established that our Internet wasn't reaching the rooms within our house, as we said it would not. Therefore they sent an engineer to move our router. A BT engineer, who was quite helpful and nothing to do with vodafone. The router then would not provide any Internet connection at all. It had a flashing red light. For many days. Therefore, we contacted Vodafone to resolve our issue (all the while, paying for the service we were not receiving). And yet it still would not work. We were told it would take 24 hours to work, everyday, for 4 days. Which equates to 96 hours.THEN, we had a phonecall from a staff member called Ahme, from the second line technical team who was one of the rudest people we have ever encountered from a company in which we trusted to provide us a service which we are PAYING for. He was absolutely infuriating, unhelpful, rude, agitating, confrontational in certain instances and just genuinley displayed unacceptable customer service. However, he was at least consistent in these attributes somewhat. Because he persisted with this behaviour until the point in which we decided it would be best to cancel this service. However, he would not let us do this in an efficient and appropriate manner. He proceeded to waste more and more of our time, also the companies time, to delay us with this request. Because he was VERY difficult.I could go on and on to show you how utterly shameful my experience was with Vodafone, however, all I can do is hope the capitalist markets prevail and see this company fail miserably within the free market so that the rest of you consumers can be spared the pain me and my wife have had to endure.To sum up:NEVER EVER EVER, choose VODAFONE!!!!!Save yourself the hassle.",Shane Dixon,2021,10,30,1,0.129,0.088,Negative

I remember asking twice.This wifi device was the most catastrophic, unreliable, poor quality and really low speed internet i have ever experienced (range as low as 1mbps) when i live in city with good internet connextion and internet 4G is not an issue.After spending hours with IT team, resetting again and again the device, changing the settings and changing the SIM, they offered me to send the device for repair.It meant to be without the device for 7-13 working days.

Vodafone team didnt care about my situation and told me to share the data from my mobile phone if i needed internet.The device sent for repair, they kept it nearly 2 months, from 13/08/2021 to 08/10/2021.Vodafone didnt contact me at all during this time and only when i started to complain, they told me the device was beyond repair and they would send me a new one.New device still not received after a week, i complained again and they said they had a shortage and could not provide until ""unknown"" date but let me know as soon as shipped.One day, it came through the post - nearly 2 month after i sent it - no tracking email or text to let me know, lucky i was home to receive the package.Unfortunately, this new device didnt resolve the issue - internet speed remained between 1mbps and 4mbps (try to watch a nice movie with this range of speed ...).I spent 4 hours trying to reach the Cancellation Team last Monday, each time i was 1st in the queue to discuss with them, i was disconnected and had to do the entire process to talk to 4 differents agents again. At 10pm, they told me they were too busy and i should try again the next day so i raised a complaint because it was 4hours of my life i would not have back.Finally, the complaint option worked, because they contacted me few days later. The dispute was resolved and the contract terminated early over the phone with someone from Complaint Team.In the end, i should have raised a complaint earlier as it was resolved during the phone call that lasted less than 15min (this is why i put 2 stars and not 0).I will update the comment once the contract is over and last bill is paid, and i made sure i didnt have to pay the Cancellation fees. It might rise to 3 stars or get down to 1 depending if Vodafone is keeping its promise.PS. one advise, don't try to resolve the issue by talking to agents, just raise a complaint - it is way quicker.",Florentina,2021,10,29,2,0.086,0.049,Negative

Offered the same deal that Joe Public would get on a Samsung S21 5G with an upfront cost of £29. Nothing in the small print stating it doesn't apply to ""Loyalty"" customer so I was given nothing. I was then offered a Samsung S20 for £8 a month more and they'd reduce the upfront cost for me to £9??? Erm excuse me do you really think that I am stupid?

674,Disappointed - Avoid Vodafone,"Vodafone. Disappointed. Issue 1:Last week (20/10) I had my contract extended with the unlimited plus 2 extras plus entertainment package.Over the chat they were super kind. Helped me and told me this is the Unlimited package. I bought a 5G ready phone too.Now it came to surface my net speed limit is 10 Mbps... Unlimited? I don't think so. And this very important information wasn't mentioned in the chat while they sold the package.Since then I'm having endless chats, trying to contact them. They are offering one time £5, £10, £15 and in the end £25 just to silence me. But I told them I don't want it. I want faster speed. 4G is capable up to 300Mbps, why do they limit me at 10Mbps and not highlighting it in the chat. They didn't tell me: ""Hey by the way this is 10Mbps, but you can get fastest available too."" I expected an unlimited package will be truly unlimited and they won't hide any important info like this.And then what do I get? Ignorance. They don't want to resolve it. They don't offer faster speed. Just repeating themselves. I know they have a plan with fastest available speed, they just don't want to give it out. What kind of customer service is this?Now I'm in a situation that I will cancel EVERYTHING. My broadband, my mobile (long time Vodafone customer), but I don't care. Of course if I cancel I will lose a good deal, getting headphones as a gift, so they made me lose out on this.______________________________Issue 2:My mobile broadband. I made a contract last year for mobile broadband at home up to 150Mbps. They told me in my area I'll get 35Mbps. I said wow! Let's do it. Since then I'm having 2-5 Mbps, I can't stream, watch Netflix, anything. Only music. Anything else is just bad quality, buffering. Told them about the issue. Multiple times. They didn't resolve it and ignored me. For one year! All I get is ""we're sorry"". Why didn't they tell me in the beginning? Who's going to compensate this?Vodafone.

I can’t access my bank account as they need to send me a code by text, I can’t activate Apple Pay for the same reasons, I haven’t used my physical cards for years and don’t know the PIN numbers I can get a pin reminder on the app HOWEVER because it’s a new device the bank has to send me a code by text.

I contacted Vodafone mid-August and they advised i will recieve the phone on the relase date at the end of august. I take annual leave for its arrival and it doesnt arrive. I call Vodafone for an explanation, which they couldnt provide, they then place anohter order. I then recieve two phones and two smart watches. It then took nearly a month to have this resolved. All the time Vodafone talk to me like I'm an idiot. They constantly apologies but only for the way you feel, rather than for what they have done. Then theres the hold music they make you endure for hours on end. Three songs, a minute and a half each, one of them is a coldplay song. Being on hold with vodafone, I'm sure, is the equivalent of the totrure music they have been rumored to play at Guantanamo Bay. Then theres the fact that no one single advisor can answer all questionds about your account. Infact, if you wish to talk about your device you will be placed on hold for aan extended period of time and then if you ask a question about your airtime you'll be transferred back and guess what, theres that hold music again.

680,"Decent network, shockingly awful customer service","So, I'll be entirely honest in this review... The first mistake was my own. I placed an upgrade order and selected the wrong colour handset, damn. Could I have lived with it? Maybe, but I live with it, I'd like to be right. Call customers services, and ask the colour of the handset to be changed. Apparently that's not possible without scrapping the whole  thing and starting again... Sigh. Okay then, let's do that.So they tell me okay, it's cancelled, just place your new order, which I do. This was 20/10/21. Two days later I'm wondering where my cancellation email is and how my other order is doing because I can't track or see them on my account. Well, my old order isn't cancelled yet apparently and my new order doesn't even exist, despite signing a new agreement with Vodafone. So, lie, its not been cancelled, but have I now ordered two phones and plans?!? No one can tell me, or at least be bothered to tell me. So raise a complaint, surely that'll get traction? I was told I'd be contacted by 26/10 to confirm my order had been cancelled. No callback was forthcoming, so today I called them to make sure everything, every open order had been cancelled and cleared... Nope, the handset is on its way (the wrong one that I originally ordered by mistake), the new plan has gone live (that I'd been told twice was cancelled).

689,Vodafone have terrible service,"I have been a customer with Vodafone periodically for over five years. I have had mobile phone contracts and I have had home broadband contracts and I’ve always left due to poor customer service.However, I was enticed to go back with Vodafone nearly two years ago with a home broadband package because the equipment, specifications and the speeds looked good, with the prices being too competitive to pass up. Unfortunately, literally, within the first week I had issues with an unstable Internet connection and intermittent drop outs at the most inconvenient of times. So I contacted Vodafone and explained that was I not happy because the service was literally non-existent.If you’re aware of how many broadband companies operate they will tell you that there is a 10 day settling in period before they can really do anything about it. Although this is generally true I felt that Vodafone used this as an excuse. I had to basically wait 10 days without any proper broadband before they would do anything about it. Being a reasonable chap, and as I’m not very good at quitting, I asked them if they could sort the problem out after two weeks. This was plenty of time for the internet to settle down. So they tried to fix the problem but were unable to abs after weeks of trying changed my connection to a static IP rather than a dynamic one because the connection was so poor. They did this for free because of the inconvenience and because literally, I had otherwise had no Internet without it. Throughout my contract the Internet connection has periodically and unexpectedly stopped, and connecting to the support team is long and tedious. Despite having apps, which look good and should make life much easier I found that the links were often broken. Once I got through to the support team they did not always solve the problem and you have to go through the same procedure over and over again you call  to try and resolve it. They are very good at convincing you they have fixed the problem when they have not. So my contract is due to expire and I have been thinking of moving to a different company even if I have to pay a few pounds extra as I would much prefer good service and any problems to be resolved quickly. Today, I rang Vodafone Customer service and after waiting for over 40 minutes I got through to someone who said they couldn’t hear me and they would ring me back which never happened. An hour later I rang Vodafone back after going through their poor menu system and managed to get through to somebody else after 30 minutes. As soon as I told them that I wanted to know when my contract was up because I was considering leaving I was abruptly cut off. So my long drawn out expectation that Vodafone would become a reliable and supportive company has never happened. In spite of my best efforts to continually give them second chances over and over, I have decided to leave them. Unfortunately because I cannot get through to customer services and when I do they terminate the call I am just going to do an online change to a different provider bypassing their customer service completely.I’m writing this review to warn other potential customers not to be fooled by attractive advertisements, exciting features and lower costs. After all, if you do not get the service you pay for nor  can you contact customer services when you need them, you are just throwing money away. My life has been severely negatively impacted throughout my time with Vodafone. Stay away from them!+++++++++++++++++++Update As you can see below Vodafone have  responded but unfortunately I do not use Facebook for security reasons but maybe I will contact them on Twitter and if anything positive happens I will post the results here. As a caveat, in my opinion their response below is poor. Most decent companies are eager to keep reliable and loyal customers and have a retention department which bends over backwards to try and make their customers happy and make amends. The response by Vodafone is very weak, and even though I had an apology the onus is put on me to contact them. This will be a chat format which is never good at communication.Most decent companies make an additional effort to contact customers themselves who have complained with legitimate reasons. Even in their response below it doesn’t bode well.",Ray,2021,10,26,1,0.103,0.116,Positive

Order placed and left the conversation, the next day got an email saying the original phone not available so changed by the operator to a new cheaper phone, he went into my account and changed the order which is illegal. Did offer any excuse and was letting me leave after 20 year's with them. Can't wait for this contract to be up to change to Tesco's phone as they give the best deal for money.I have already sent messages to you on Facebook messenger before to resolve this and it still makes my blood boil that the operator went into my account without my knowledge and changed the order. I was forced to take what I was given as it was a Christmas present for my daughter so no I will not forget what happened as easily as that. The operator broke the law and if I had more time I would have found legal advice on the matter but as it was before Christmas and I didn't have time to do anything other than take a new contract with Vodafone and not let my child down for her new phone for Christmas. As soon as the contracts are up we are off for good.

Could no longer do online banking on my phone and more importantly could not WhatsApp or FaceTime my son in Australia (even with 4g).Spent most of that weekend trying to sort it out.  One customer service person went through a network reset which didn’t work and in the end said my phone was broken and I’d have to upgrade…. Tried to go through upgrade, ordered a phone and then had to electronically sign a loan agreement to get a new phone. When I tried to sign it wouldn’t accept my post code. Tried for 3 days….still wouldn’t accept it. Got through to the online chat who eventually told me to ring 191 which I did. Followed the choices for upgrade to be told through an automated service to go to the online chat……Upshot is phone order cancelled by Vodafone.  I told them to email me not ring me….. sent off a verification confirmation twice….. then at 9.11 am today they tell me they are going to ring me between 11 and 1 pm.  Emily rings at 11.41 am and I miss the call. Emily then texts me to say that as I didn’t answer the phone they have closed my case.Emily has not tried to ring me again up to 1 pm, she tried the once and just closed my case.My life does not revolve around Vodafone, just when it might be convenient to them to ring, does not mean it is for me.

When you phone Vodafone you get a load of automated options then you get sent a text link to refer you to an online chat which takes a lot of time. My direct debit didn't get set up through no fault of my own (fault between Vodafone and carphone warehouse), so I had to chat to ask what was going on. I had to pay manually and set up a new dd. Then on my next bill they charged me a late fee. How cheeky. Back to phoning and chatting...Despite their good coverage claims my data is often very poor. We got a plan out for my daughter too.

705,Terrible customer service.. I'm off!,"I have/had 4 contracts for my family with Vodafone and am in the middle of transferring every one of them to another network. I worked for Vodafone for 19 years and can honestly say they were an excellent employer, however my experiences as a Vodafone UK customer since I left have been appalling. My bills had escalated to over £200 p/mth as all of my contracts had reached their contract end date.Firstly, Vodafone made no proactive attempt to reduce the bills to a SIM only contract now that I had paid fully for the handsets as a part of the monthly cost. Be aware that it is down to the user to know when the contract end is and when you have finished paying the handset cost, if you don't proactively make the changes then they will happily continue to charge you at the old rates far above the cost to them  for a SIM only service. It is time Ofcom stepped in to ban this behaviour, it has been going on too long.Secondly, trying to get through to someone on the phone to discuss changes is basically a wasted effort. I waited up to an hour on 2 occasions and still could not get through.I then tried the chat services and joined the first queue at number 58. 30 minutes later i was connected and after a brief encounter with an invisible agent was told that they could not help and i was automatically transferred to another queue at number 118 before I had managed to finish off my final question. No thank you, no nothing. Just cut off and transferred. After another unbearable period of time of not being connected I decided to drop the chat and head into the local shop.After a short wait in the shop, the assistant, on seeing my account gasped slightly and stated ""Oh yes you are paying a lot aren't you"". Confident she could help, she went on to ask me lots of questions on how old my family were and what she thought the best plan was. I tried to explain that I didn't need her to ask me questions as I knew how much data each of my family needed and what price I wanted to roughly pay for SIM only contracts. All I wanted was the best price in each category. Finally I got some sense from her and after many more questions about what was included or not (while she tried to continually upsell me) I had some clarity on what their best offer was. She asked if I wanted to change my plans and I said that I would get back to her once I had compared with the competition. It was at this point that she clearly stated that it would not be wise to move networks. When I asked why she told me that it could take up to two months and the trouble involved was not worth it. When I stated that the process to transfer a number to another network should take a maximum of 48hrs she stated that it was regularly not the case and it was better to stay with Vodafone. I then asked her clearly ""So what you are saying is that despite the fact it sates that number porting should take approximately 2 working days, you are saying it could and most likely will take up to two months"" which she responded to me with ""Yes most likely and you will have to give one months notice too"" (this is not the case by the way when out of contract on the plans I had) I left the shop, went to the competition. Found far better plans and rates. Then the task of trying to leave Vodafone online started. If you have tried to find the PAC code online to transfer your number to another network, you will understand my pain. I had to google the process and even then it was near impossible as the code is buried deep in the system and options. This lot really don't want people to leave.Once I got the PAC codes online, I transferred one plan to another network in under 24 hrs and the others are going through in approximately 2 working days.In summary, I was being massively overcharged for a service that I no longer needed to pay for, I wasted approximately 8+ hours trying to contact Vodafone UK through every channel available to get clarity on a better deal, I was misinformed (call it what you like)  in store by a sales representative and I ultimately got a better deal in exactly the stated timeframes from other networks.What a terrible customer experience.",Lance,2021,10,25,1,0.065,0.082,Positive

So basically I was willing to pay more to Vodafone, but they refused my offer. You can't make this up, and then the reply below :))--------------------- I've been with Vodafone for about 10 days now and I've already formed my opinion. Disappointing. I purchased the Gigacube mobile broadband with a 200gb data limit. At the time, they were running a 'half-price for first 6-months offer'. Today, I called them to change my plan to unlimited data allowance while keeping the same offer, considering the fact that I am still in my 'cooling off' period. However, I was told it can't happen and to make the change, I won't be able to keep the offer, which I obviously refused.I find this rather strange.

711,Not valued as a long term customer,"I have been trying to upgrade my phone and contract since it was due for renewal in Nov 2020. The first person I spoke to said I was a highly valued customer as I had been with them for so long and they would therefore give me a good deal, but I did not have time to go through the process then. However, after speaking to three different operators on separate occasions after that, to try and get this elusive ""good deal"", the only deals I was offered as a ""valued"" customer were exactly the same as anyone who was just joining them, or on one occasion a small discount that didn't match the same offer Three were doing at the time, which I would have been happy with if they had matched it. Apparently operators have no ability to respond to customers on a case by case basis anymore and there is no one you can talk to about this other than the operators due to a restructure, so when I said there is no reason for me to stay with Vodafone UK, the response was simply, ""I understand"". Great.Today I tried one last time and because Vodafone UK now split their airtime plans from their phone plans (for some reason I fail to understand), apparently I would be entering into a loan contract and was therefore asked to provide my monthly earnings and expenses, as if I am applying for a mortgage!?Something I have never had to do before with them. After being with the company for approximately 20 years and never missing a payment, it was a bit of a slap in the face to need to have a credit check done and be offered the exact same deal as anyone who was joining them for the first time. Vodafone UK, you have changed and not in a good way. If I am going to be treated like a new customer with no trust based on a prior customer relationship, I think it is time for me to look elsewhere and be a new customer and I would encourage others reading this to think about doing so because loyalty doesn't mean anything to Vodafone anymore.

Eventually I was told ‘it will be ready in 2 days honestly absolutely confident it will be fine there was an unexpected fault’.

As well as breaching their own customer service code of conduct (which is published on their website) and breaching numerous industry regulations, they have also actually broken the law in they way they have dealt with this issue (or not dealt with actually!). The training of their call centre staff is terrible and if you have a problem that they can’t resolved quickly using their scripts, they get annoyed with you, but actively try to stop you escalating to a manager & become belligerent. Their back office staff don’t seem to be bothered about fixing problems with accounts that are a result of their own errors in the first place. Customer relations are next to useless, make promises on timescales to review complaints and call you back, and then  don’t bother. I was ready to take my case to the ombudsman, but they begged me to allow them another 2 weeks to deal with the problem (which has been going on since April) which I foolishly agreed to.

In my most recent dealings I have experienced ridiculous delays in speaking to someone after navigating your way past the mind numbing automated service which is not fit for purpose . The level of customer service is at best disgraceful.I am now looking to leave .. if I can ever get to speak to someone  who is able to sort my issue out so I can access my account (now totals 6 hrs of waiting on the phone over 3 days being cut off ,issue not resolved ,fobbed off with stories about system issues etc ). I would never recommend this shower of a company to anyone from now on. That is without the issues with less and less signal coverage which seems to happen more and more at various locations. They really need to overhaul how they deal with customers or they will end up with noneTHANK YOU FOR YOUR GENERICALLY GENERATED RESPONSE . As a postscript I have just spent another hour with customer services trying to sort this out. The lady was very nice but the upshot is still not sorted and continues . I have to say the service is not fit for purpose .

736,ROBBERY IN A DAYLIGHT. £180 STOLEN,Vodafone was charging me almost 38 pounds for 24 months with an expensive device for 100gb data.After that 24 months they started charging  me almost 74...I got in touch and they refunded me 108 pounds and I was convinced they were going to charge me only 38 even though device was already paid off.GREED CONTINUED and few days back I checked my bank statement to find out they still charge almost 74 per month for data and minutes. ROBBERY IN A DAYLIGHT! I am fuming. Called customer services  and there's nothing they can do.It's been 5 months since the refund so they legally stole 180 pounds and only offered 40 pounds refund. 38 POUNDS pcm would be still high for data and minutes but they want more and think it's fair. I had mental issues and they took advantage.DISGRACEWill shop around in may for new broadband which funny enough is not working for past 2 weeks plus.,Jakub K,2021,10,21,1,0.015,0.074,Positive

I Can say for sure that I will be cancelling all of my business deals with them and switching when they are upSo I have been with Vodafone for over 15 years, and generally I have to say I have had no issues with them. Signal I my area could be a little better, but its fine as is.But recently I renewed/took out a new deal on the broadband, it was a 3 year deal and £3 a month more. But I can't get any better speeds in my area and they was offering a Google deal worth £450 chucked in for free.I was told I should have the items after 14 days, but up to a maximum of 30 days.30 days had passed since my contract went live, and still no Google devices. So I contacted Vodafone.After alot of messing around I got sent a link and was told to contact getgofone (owned by Vodafone)Filled in the form as requested, but 5 days later i still hadn't had a reply. Got hold of Vodafone again but they said they couldn't help and that I have to sort it with getgofone.Actually managed to get some responses from them in the end with many day delays between email, there is no contact number and they didn't call me.Now I have been told I will get my devices sent after cooling down period. But it has been 50 days! If I am still in my cooling down period, I will cancel my contract.

738,Absolutely disgraceful set-up,"Absolutely disgraceful set-up. I’ve been with Vodafone for over 20 years and they’ve completely fallen by the wayside in recent months. I spoke recently to a guy called Zak who completely messed up an upgrade as he quite clearly had no idea what he was doing. No call-back as promised by him. Then today I spoke for 2 HOURS 9 MINUTES to a guy called Daniel who tried to clear up Zak’s mess only to create another unholy mess himself. They did a hard search on my credit file for a credit agreement which they never did send over to me as they seem incapable of knowing even how to email documents. So they’ve also managed to interfere with my credit score as well as leave me without the phone I upgraded to.  Such low level intelligence should never be allowed in such a large company. To top it all, the  complaints department that I spoke to couldn’t help either as there wasn’t even a record of my upgrading, even though I spent collectively over 3 HOURS setting one up! No returned calls even though promises are made. They are an absolute shower with not a clue how to give ANY form of customer service, let alone good customer service. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS.2 days after I posted the above, Voda added insult to injury by then merging what had always been 2 separate direct debit payments for 2 telephone numbers into 1. I was alerted to this by a text from them showing my payments had doubled. I hadn’t asked for this, they just took it upon themselves to do it. SIX DAYS after my initial call to them, they still hadn’t sorted out my upgrade. My call log shows over 7 HOURS of either trying to speak to someone or being pushed from pillar to post. I made an official complaint and they promised a call back in 24 hours. They lied - no one ever got back to me. They offered me £40 compensation. I told them to stick it.

Hardly surprising as the content of 4 Vodafone Reps was despicable.I have a significant shareholding in Vodafone and will be writing to investor relations, Chairman and CEO. How this organisation is permitted to trade, with the current customer dissatisfaction profile amazes me. Trustpilot rates it as the WORST network operator, with circa 80%, 1 star ratings. I’ve never been treated with such complete incompetence.I anticipate my formal complaint will achieve nothing. I doubt this company can be joined up enough to follow their own complaint code.Michael Gibbins.**********************************************Vodafone.. you’ve responded as below, which is the first step in good customer relations. Thank you.However,1) It’s a standard reply. To the 88% on Trustpilot: all who are one star, dissatisfied customers.2) I don’t have any idea why you advise, I’d want to use social media, Facebook or Twitter to deal with this.. what is this all about? I just want to pick a phone up and talk to someone. What is the purpose of this ‘social media’ advice? Especially, relating to my Mum. 93 years old.3) I got a new contract for my mother, today, without achieving retaining her number. That’s taken two days. Confirmation of the contract contained the following statement: ‘monthly charges will increase in January by consumer prices index rate… PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 3.9%!!!. Nothing advised when taking the contact on yesterday.. So I guess this is yet ANOTHER complaint to take up with the thieves at Vodafone.4) My experience mirrors many I’ve had at Vodafone. I’d hoped new CEO Ahmed Essam might have started to sort out your customer service issues that Nick Jeffries left in tatters over a decade.. claiming he’d ‘turned around the business 😂’.

Although their customer service is notoriously horrendous, the product itself is not that bad, so if you manage to avoid talking with them, it's an OK provider to be with. I've wasted hours today to get something as simple as an upgrade for a long term client sorted. Feeling so frustrated, that I am not even bothering to go into details of my today's ordeal with them. But it was enough for me to finally request a PAC code, and to switch over to another provider. Really puzzling how they can't get their customer service right. As they say, the fish stinks from the head, so maybe they should do a proper overhaul there. If others can provide good (or better) customer service, how come one of the largest players on the market cannot get their act together.

I haven't been a Vodafone customer for 13 years, so of course I expected and reported fraud. Despite it being connected to said person (who I haven't spoken to for years) who had kept the contract going, Vodafone allowed this to continue, NOT doing any security checks and the account being registered to 2 new addresses I have never lived at. I understand accountability for part of this, but I have a legal letter from Vodafone apogising for the fraud on my account and offering to close the account and quash any outstanding balance. They have lied, they did not close the account remove the charges, and are denying the letter I have in my possession. Vodafone's security checks, support team and fraud teams have FAILED. They know I haven't ordered the new contract and that the data hasn't even been used since July 2021, but have decided to keep the account running, and are selling on to a collection agency in full knowledge that I will be landed with a default or CCJ on my credit file.Although I know taking such a large firm of bullies to court is costly, time consuming and stressful, I threatened them with legal action. Their response was basically 'go for it'. I then begged for negotiation of the outstanding to get it cleared and gone, the fraud team said to me, ""We will not negotiate, all charges stand"". And even added that by the time this account closes another couple £100 will be added. Despite my mistakes and their mistakes, and being a multi billion £ company.

I have had countless more problems.They did not fix my account leading to them cutting off my internet as I was unable to pay on time. Then I had to find a way to pay. Then I was wrongly given a late fee for next payment, despite them admitting it was their fault. The person I spoke to at the time said I could only dispute it after a certain day. After this day another person said they corrected the amount, but I told them the amount had not changed. They replied that they would then put credit on to fix the issue. They did neither of these things and I ended up paying the wrong late fee. I am not in the process of making a complain AND finally leaving this completely incompetent and unprofessional company.

I do same ping test on that site and results are 10x better on MOBILE network. This is really sad. I already spoken with your customer services. I will cancel the contract.

Why bill some one month's later for one pence ? Why bill some one who is not a Vodafone customer as I believe you need to update your computer systems as what is the one pence for ? How is billing some one for one pence helping the environment and why bill for an account that is no longer in use since July 2021? Lots of questions but getting no response from Vodafone to my email address so having to go on here in the hope that one of the billing team or directors can reply to me by email address. I have had to go to resolve and ofcom to find out why billing for one pence ? It's crazy and laughable and a waste of time, paper, stamp cost more than the bill itself. It shows profit more important to Vodafone then the environment with the paper billing for one pence. It shows an error as well as account is not in use. Hopefully when resolve and ofcom get involved they help Vodafone resolve this complaint. I am not a Vodafone customer so should not have received the bill when I did in October 2021. I noticed Vodafone lots of billing errors or over charging customers during the year 2021. If you are a Vodafone customer double check everything if on a contract.

After about 3/4 hour I was asked to pay the above monthly charge amount £52, apparently my credit limit! And a measly £13 over the agreed cap. For this amount they had disconnected me leaving me without communication abroad at short notice. My wife has an EE account and in similar situation offered her the option of 10GB at £20 to tide her over without threat of disconnection. Somewhat of a contrast. I was promised reconnection in 24 hours or less. It took almost 48 hours. I have complained through their complaints system.

810,**Please Read** THIS IS A JOKE COMPANY,"**Please Read**I’ve never had to write a bad review on this website before but after my horrific experience with this company I have to write one.Firstly, i’d like to say that I have been a loyal customer with Vodaphone since Jan 2019. Everything started off amazing and the plan was supposed to be for £27pm (Home Broadband)The first few months went perfect, internet connection was super quick and there were no extra charges, exactly a £27 charge each month as agreed.2019 to end of 2020 I sometimes would have a minor issues but nothing they couldn’t fix.Fast forward to this year, I do not know what happened to this company but the customer service is now an absolute joke, like seriously the people that you speak to just blatantly lie to your face and don’t even write the correct notes on their systems so you have to repeat everything. They put you on hold for over 30minutes while they do nothing just to come back to you and tell you nonsense.January of this year my internet connection has suddenly changed and started to be reaalllly slow and then it would cut out at times. I am working from home so this was badly affecting me during my shifts. Not only that, but I also had realised that the bill had been increased to £37.50 and then to £37.92!!!! I have no idea why that happened or why is hasn’t been changed after I complained about it!! I never added any sort of extra onto the contract..That’s not even the main problem..3 weeks ago I was sent a new router as my internet had been cutting out (as usual) after an engineer had to be sent out to make sure my internet was actually “not working” (their words not mine). First 2 weeks it was working as it should but then all of a sudden just 4 days ago it completely stops working again!!!! Like the connection is literally dead.. I can’t connect my phone and I see the bars on my screen but the actual internet is not working at all. I have been on the phone for over 2hours for the past 4 days and they have been telling me it will be sorted in the next 24 hours for the past 4 days in a row now!!!😡🤬I have been patient with them as I know they once used to be am amazing company with brilliant service and have kept hope in them I have now taken the decision that i will have to cancel the contract and leave.

To top it all, we asked them to keep hold of the phone while we negotiated our options with them and we have just had a message to say it's on the way back to us today!

I was never informed and why would a technical error cancel the entire order? ! Why does their system not simply generate an error message for the operative to go back and correct. They said it was a computer error and someone should have been in touch, but wasn't their fault. All they could say was I will have to wait another 7 days for the service, there is nothing they can do. I suggested that as the new system can be turned on at midnight, they can courier me the new modem so it arrives tomorrow. Oh no, they can't do that, I will have to wait another 7 days, minimum. Well there is something I can do, and that was cancel and get out of this incompetent company ASAP. I suggest you do the same.

I'm way past my upgrade date and I get occasional offers 'just for me' (not explicit, but this is implied by the wording). The price has been no different to anyone else asking (i.e. via website as a ""new"" customer). Moreover, other suppliers are consistently cheaper, and by a lot. You get a £29 up front fee even for a PAYG contract on an iphone with Vodaphone, not so in other places, and it's £15 a month cheaper elsewhere for identical phone and terms. I phoned them to try to avoid the small amount of hassle to transfer my number elsewhere and offered to show proof of a better quote for the same contract. They wouldn't budge. They've largely ignored me for the best part of 10 years and within two hours of requesting a PAC code, they're phoning me!

Engineer calls 2 hours late saying he is outside but I am obviously not in, dont bother trying to go home as Im told I will have wifi tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and no wifi still. Called again and am told an engineer will come on the following Friday. Thursday afternoon get a call from the same woman saying SHE didnt book it in right and hes not coming and the earliest date another engineer can come is over 2 weeks from now!!! After lots of complaining and repeating myself in longest most drawn out conversation ever, with the rudest most useless person, she says she has found an earlier space in 6 days. Am told I will get compensation for days we have already paid for. Say ok because dont have a choice. This day comes and surprise surpise no one turns up. Call again and guess what! She didnt book us in for that date! And booked us in the later date after all and didnt ring to tell us. Hours wasted waiting for no one AGAIN. Nothing they can do to get someone earlier.

More than 6 months later I received a message from debt collectors - turned out I haven't paid the final closing bill (took me a lot of effort to find out that as they linked my delivery address to my account rather than my residential address). I was expecting them to send me the last bill once they received back the device, but as I never received it, I completely forgot about it. After hours of trying to find out what happened, it turned out their emails failed to reach me. When asked why they haven't contacted me by phone, it turned out they were sending notifications to the number assigned to my Gigacube that I have returned. They tried to rub into my face their customer agreement, as if they are not responsible for the failed communications which was followed by all the inconvenience I had to endure with the debt collector agency.

I wasted like 4 hours of my life speaking to various agents and was misinformed multiple times. My contract expired on the 2nd so I wanted to upgrade to a phone plan, iPhone 13 pro. First agent told me they can’t see where it’s available in store and that I need to go through the full purchase plus credit checks to find out. Put me through to someone else. Spent like an hour on the phone with them sorting everything out and towards the end the call disconnected. No one called me back so I did - came through to another person who said they can’t put me back through to the same woman and had to do the same thing all over again!!! Then also disconnected!? The 4th person I spoke to promised they’ll call me back if I disconnect but then said they can’t help me basically… and then the 5th said they don’t know how their colleagues were able to see store availability and he doesn’t know how to do it. Finally, i gave up on trying to get the phone in store same day and decided to get a delivery to my address - I was told by every single one of these agents if I choose that option the phone will be with me on Tuesday. The last person I spoke to (the 6th person for the day) said iPhone 13 pro is not in stock anywhere and deliveries will take 4-5 weeks… I questioned her given all her colleagues told me Tuesday but she was certain. Then I went on the website and it allowed me to make an order for Tuesday.

The speeds have been fine. Have had drop outs a few times a year but they are short lived and back to normal within minutes, nothing to get frustrated about. My husband says the internet is slow (we have the super fast fibre) and prefers to use his mobile data but I honestly do not notice the speed being slow, maybe because he doesn’t use it relieving the pressure of demand? All in all I would probably recommend Vodafone broadband. At the moment we are out of contract so our monthly payment is more than if we were in contract, I haven’t renewed a contract as I like the fact that I have the option to just leave if I want to, but so far I haven’t needed to.

After several attempts of calling from my partners phone when he came home from work, being on the phone to them for an hour at least each time, I still do not have a live number. So to say I am angry would be an understatement. Being with a company for 13 years means absolutely nothing to Vodaphone and it’s simply not acceptable.

888,Vodafone - Increase in Early Upgrade Fee after signing a New Contract.         Thank you to Trustpilot for an…,"Thank you to Trustpilot for an excellent platform to share experiences with other customers.Vodafone.......firstly what they do right: good network coverage; competitive pricing; no problems with signal or consistency of signal. I have been with Vodafone for 22 years. I recently 26/09/21 signed up to a new contract. But I have never until very recently 27/9/21 had to contact customer services. Here's the story ....I have been watching my 'Early Upgrade' fee slowly and consistently reduce over many weeks. Last week I signed up to a new contract and have been placed on a waiting list of 5-6wks for the new iphone 13PM, which is all fair enough during these crazy times. I went on-line to review my new contract and noticed my 'Early Upgrade' fee had suddenly jumped UP by 10%. The new contract I signed showed the correct early upgrade fee of £70.19. There is a clause that states I will stay on my old contract until dispatch of the 5-6wk delayed phone during which time the upgrade fee will reduce as expected, which is all very good. So why did this fee suddenly jump by 10% to £77.78 the day after I signed the new contract ???Simple enough query for customer services, right?Wrong ! At time of writing I have had two failed conversations with a call centre which I believe to be on the Indian sub-continent. I have sent three e-mails to complain. I experienced very poor quality lines; very polite people unsuccessfully working remotely and reading from a script in very broken English. Off-script conversations went nowhere, nevermind trying to get the operator to understand my complaint.My speculation is that Vodafone do not invest in Customer Services, they outsource to third-party poorly resourced call centres, who are provided with strict guidelines to say only scripted comments. They are given no authority to resolve complaints and it seems to me that the processes rely on customers giving up in frustration. I would further speculate that Vodafone are playing a numbers game in a very competitive market. Big marketing budgets attracting new customers; inadequate customer services budget losing customers. If the first is bigger than the second, then job done, the company grows ??! Back to my complaint, I suspect that Vodafone have knowingly and deliberately increased my current 'early upgrade fee' so that when the new phone comes I will be paying exactly what I have signed up for the other day without any further reductions. I am more than willing to be proved wrong but as yet I haven't been for reasons given above. Summary, I still maintain that Vodafone are a good company, but if anything goes wrong for a customer .....forget it. There is nobody there to deal with it. The rating is based on my recent experience, which is what it asks for.The Vodafone response………Good morning Simon, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review and letting us know what's been happening. I appreciate you providing this feedback. I've not heard of the early upgrade fee increasing for any reason. I'm glad to hear you've been charged the correct one. If there's anything at all I can help with, please come and speak to my team on FacebookThanks, Vodafone Social Media TeamVery polite and friendly reply but, anyone see a problem with this response ?  No substance to it and materially incorrect. No acknowledgment or engagement with the issue. In fact the response confirms that my complaint is valid and going unresolved. This person has not properly read my review/issue and failed to understand the problem. And has also made an incorrect statement about “being charged correctly”I will repeat that I think Vodafone have written an algorithm to ensure that customers Early Upgrade Fee is bumped when signing a new contract to ensure that no actual net further reduction takes place while stuck on the 5-6 wk waiting list. Think about it ……On 26th Sept my Early Upgrade Fee was £70.19 this amount was placed into the contract. On the 27th this figure then went up to £77.78 having been told there was a 5-6 wk delay on new phones being dispatched and thus the date of commencement of the new contract. By increasing the amount to correspond with the expected delay they ensure no further effective reduction …. !!!!!!! they are cleverly freezing it without it being obvious hoping you don’t notice. Why go to all this trouble? Consider how many customers are on the waiting list for new phones, tens, hundreds of thousands if this has happened to each then there is a £1m right there. Perfectly deniable - and as you can see from the response I got, not even acknowledged.Two issues then:a) Shockingly bad Customer Services.b) Failure to engage with the substance of my complaint.",Simon Watson,2021,9,30,1,0.109,0.097,Negative

Tried via my Vodafone account processed order 5 times for it to be rejected. Drove to store in Macclesfield staff were great but after 2hrs 30 in the store the order was still not processed. The system runs on Windows 97, and basically is unstable and failed several times. The manager was equally frustrated.

Gave notice to cancel my contract in June, contacted them again in July as they had taken another payment that was not due because notice was given and contract cancelled.  They said they did not have any notice on the account.  Then when checking they found it and was their error.  They refunded payment and told us account was clear and cancellation was actioned that day. Received a letter from debt collecting agency today for cancellation fee of £30.84 which Vodafone has assured us due to their error it was written off!!!! So far have spent hours on the phone to the debt  agency to get this sorted who have also told us to speak with Vodafone.  OMG after 1 1/2 on line chat and then cut off because they finish at 5pm!!! called a third number and got through only to be put on hold whilst the operator spoke with the collections department to sort.  Said she would be back in a couple of minutes, 45 mins later and still on bloody hold!!!!!!.

Their internal complaint was closed before this without a resolution stating I had agreed to the close. I did immediately update them to say it wasn't agreed and should not be closed, but Vodafone chose to ignore that. In the internal complaint they offered compensation (I never asked for it) but that never got paid either.

You have been warned!We are a business and we signed up for about 40-50 sim cards + several 5G routers. We began experiencing issues logging into the account and have been unable to log into the vodafone online account for more than 2 months now. The issue was raised multiple times now with no satisfactory result. I have exhausted all possible means and routes of getting their attention and help to no avail. Our account manager person always refers us to call 191 because she is unable to assist or raise support requests from her end. When we call we have to wait to be transferred to the right department who then always say we have to wait further 24-48 hours for the changes to take effect or for them to get back to us. They usually say the account needs to be reset, cleansed (yes as if it is possessed by demons), the whole account deleted and set up again from scratch. All the while we are just going round and round with no clear progress or resolution from Vodafone. Some time ago, I raised a complaint with Vodafone and a new team based outside of UK took over. I get calls from them twice a week if not more and we have done a waiting game of them trying to do exactly what was already tried, reset, cleanse, delete and set up the account from scratch. The person who calls me always has to excuse herself to talk to tech team and she would never actually allow me to talk to them directly because she was unable to transfer me. I get promises that this time it will be different and I they will fix it. Obviously nothing helps and we are still unable to log in as of today. I have screenshots with various errors which are thrown up by their internal Vodafone system. The most frequent form of error is ""Sorry - An unexpected error occurred when trying to log you in. Please wait a moment then try again."" I have asked countless times to speak to managers or raise this issue with senior management and I was promised call-backs which never materialised. At one time I was able to talk to someone from UK call centre who thought they knew what the issues was and have suggested that we go to a physical Vodafone store and ask staff to manually upgrade our account from limited to large business. The other time, someone else suggested that it may be to do with Vodafone's recent upgrade of their billing system. All of these of course were just guesses and no real resolution or assistance was offered. I also spoke to Jack who asked me to send him the screenshots via his Vodafone email. He promised to forward those to a technical team who will be able to resolve the issue once and for all. He also promised not to leave it and get to the bottom of it. Well of course nothing came out of it. My subsequent email to him went unanswered and it's been 2 weeks already so I won't hold my breath.Today I received a call from an Indian support centre with the guy who claimed to be a manager. He began to verify my account, I gave him my full name, address, postcode, mobile number, business name, date of birth and email address. He then proceeded to ask for 2 characters from my security pin. I know the pin I gave is correct, he told me it is not and the reason is because when they wipe our account they reset the security pin also so of course it wasn't matching. I made him aware of this and said I have now had numerous instances like that where I had to reset the security pin because someone constantly wipes it. Instead of telling me he will send a 4-6 digit code to my mobile number he proceeded asking me how much we pay for our mobiles a month and how many mobiles we have. I said to him we took out a lot of lines lately and I'm unable to give him precise numbers because I'm unable to log into our Vodafone account and access this information. We also don't get invoices sent to our email so I would only know if I had access to account which we don't. And payments are dealt with by our finance department so I'm unable to retrieve this info on the spot for him. He then said in order to proceed further he would have to send me a link via email or mobile where I would have to provide my personal ID to verify it is me (takes 24 hours). I have denied the request especially since the call was from him there was no way to verify this is a legitimate call from Vodafone although it most likely is I did not want to take chances + I don't really have to go through all of this when they keep resetting the security pin themselves! Further, the woman I keep getting calls from seems to work from home and her line is almost always horrible and it almost always goes quiet when I answer. I can never hear her so I have no choice but to hang up and she never retries to call me back instead sends me a text to inform that she will attempt to call at a later date.",Arthur,2021,9,15,1,0.035,0.044,Positive

Now I have a cable running across my living room floor. I’m sure if I tripped over it and broke my neck Vodafone would fight me tooth and nail not to take responsibility.

The problem is how long it's taken to resolve the issue with Vodafone and every time I call them I'm told different things about how the issue will be resolved. First was that DPD would go back to collect the phone and send it on to me. This never happened. More recently they told my DPD was investigating it and they'd call me back in 3-5 days to let me know the outcome. 5 days passed and heard nothing. Called Vodafone again and they told me DPD closed the case because the phone was delivered to the right address, which is wrong. Now I have to wait another 24-48 hours before Vodafone management call me back. It's ridiculous that I'm now paying for a phone I don't have that should be been delivered two weeks ago.

It was a complete disaster, and nobody could call me for three weeks. They couldn't get Wi-Fi calling to work on my approved phone. Completely useless time wasters. I spent days talking to them, going around in circles. Eventually, I put a three sim in my phone, and it all worked like magic. The wifi calling is fantastic. Vodafone is hopeless.They will never fix their network if the authorities allow them to lie in their sales material about coverage.

As the clock runs, I have just passed the ONE HOUR mark. This, of course is after the thrill of speaking to a plastic voice set to frustrate any attempt to speak to a human being. The only way to overcome this guardian of the Vodafone Company is to tell the plastic voice you wish to cancel your contract - that did it! But it did not prevent the hour and ten minutes of caterwauling in which several sets of tone deaf five-year-olds have been recorded to make the wait as unpleasant as possible!Why not use the much vaunted computer access? That is even worse.  As an example of the total incompetence of this joke of a company. I received a text telling me my ""content bar"" on my mobile had been set.The next text told me the setting had been removed.The next text told me the ""content bar"" had been set.The next text... You've guessed it.The ""content bar"", I learned subsequently, governs the amount of content considered to be ""adult"" you permit. As far as my mobile is concerned, don't 'view' anything - it's a phone and (if necessary) a text device. Later I tried to watch an ancient Western via a well known site dedicated to ancient Westerns. Suddenly my screen was filled with a notice telling me that my contents bar didn't allow me to watch from this site. Ah, thought I, this must be the adult content, well, I want to make up my own mind, even if Jeff Chandler, John Wayne and others of their ilk were considered a bit hairy in their day.To put things right, I tried to log in to my Vodafone account and even my details were not recognised.Hence the lost hour and ten minutes of my life.The saddest thing about Vodafone is that the people we do manage to speak to are great ambassadors for a company that does not deserve them;  they do their best to put things right. Vodafone does not appear to appreciate them or their customers.Remember the power of General Motors in the '70's and 80's? No company is invulnerable, as that Company's later record shows. Vodafone should take note and become sensitive to the needs of their customers and more attentive to the feedback from their staff. Yes, five moons for Vodafone.Four days ago I received this reply:""Thank you for taking the time to leave your review and providing that feedback.""It's disappointing to hear about the poor experience..."" see below.

1014,I speak as I find - I am impressed.,I speak as I find. I ordered Vodafone Fast Fibre 2 on 27/8/21. The online ordering process was simple. I needed the WiFi hub delivering to a different address to the installation and I was assured via webchat that this could be arranged during the booking process (it could). I was offered an installation date of 10/9/2021 and was advised that the router/hub would be delivered 3 days in advance of installation.Communication by email and text during the process from both Vodafone and BT Openreach was excellent. The router was delivered on the Tuesday prior to the Friday installation. The BT guys rang me about 10 minutes before their arrival. Once they had left I noticed that I had a dial-tone on the phone immediately and once the router had updated and rebooted I had a full broadband service.The only reason I am not giving a full 5 star review is that the VF order tracking system did not recognise my order number. It did for a few hours after placing the order but then ceased to recognise it. Also the VF account could not be accessed until today - the date of the installation.

Firstly, they have removed wifi services on the London underground and will be the first to start charging when travelling to the EU from Jan 2022. How am i meant to let friends know I'm 5mins away if i can’t message them on the tube?!  I suspect one of their values at head office (which is stuck on a wall/ toilet door) says ‘customer centric’ ‘obsess over customers’, but they are so far removed from their customers I would sack your Customer Insights Manager. The ‘my very’ rewards are shocking - again not in tune with customers and everything on offer, you could get on Groupon. Your rewards are not even rewards. Take a leaf out of O2 when it comes to rewards. I am not only a phone pay monthly customer but also a broadband customer. I tried to organise the home move yesterday and the pain it took to get me through to a member of the CX team was painful. The automated line didn’t work - i think i said ‘change of address’ at least 7 times and the ‘tell us in a few words what your looking for today’ just didn't register. Maybe it was my Devon accent that threw them off. I now have to wait over two weeks before it can be reinstalled. There was no suggestion on what to do in the meantime e.g you could have asked ‘do you work from home / need internet’ YES. ‘Ok, let us see what we can do’.

That and switching networks was too much of a hassle. Vodafone does charge more than the average company but convenience and added services prevented me from leaving. However Vodafone have decided to remove the Wi-Fi on the London underground and it seems that O2 and EE still do. I’ve chatted to many customer service representatives and they seem To lack empathy about this. Whilst this was a free service, it was removed without any communication to customers. During my time at Vodafone I have also had issues with receiving a promotional product at the beginning of the new term. It took an extra months to receive this product and was again another reason that I stayed with them. I’m now at a point where enough is enough.

1027,Warning: your payments will NOT decrease when your contract ends!,"I took out a 2 year contract with them through Carphone Warehouse (who wisely no longer deal with them) as a Cyber Monday deal on a new phone. The contract ended during the lockdown and I was unable to contact them (phone signal was too weak to make a phone call at home or at work, couldn't access the site because I didn't know any online sign in details, online assistant didn't load, no email address I tried was monitored and stores were closed), but I figured at least the phone is paid off so my monthly payments will be less now. They even emailed me saying they would charge me a few pounds less until I told them if I wanted to upgrade. Instead the payments doubled! I tried looking at the bill but there's no breakdown to explain what you're actually paying for. (I called a supplier at work once and it cost me about £6 for a 5 minute call even though I have unlimited minutes on my contract.) When the shops finally opened I went to cancel my contract. They can't do that in the shops, I had to call the helpline from the shop. It turns out the amount they charge you isn't for phone and line rental like other companies, it's one payment that won't go down when the phone contract is completed. Then they claimed that because the contract ended, there was a promotional price on my contract that ended too (this is not true, they got my data allowance wrong when I took out the contract and I suspect they corrected it on their system by applying some sort of offer. I definitely was NOT told about any limited time on any offer price. It was just extra data included on a Cyber Monday deal by Carphone Warehouse and no time frame was mentioned on the site or in writing.) My advice is to avoid them.

Nor can I order the sim over the phone or through sales chat as they are not interested because I'm not spending enough*** Edit. Another hour of my life wasted talking to Vodafone. Was passed from pillar to post. The reply I got was useless. Was passed from Kerry in sales to Sanchit in customer service and John in Broadband. All they wanted to do was to pass me back to the other and get rid of me. Are you seriously telling me you can't delete an old account in this day and age?

When swapping sims, my phone got locked and I needed an MCK code. I rang Vodafone customer services. The guy I spoke to promised it'll all be sorted and he will personally see it's done and that he will call me the next day to confirm everything. Fast forward 24 hrs, I rang them again using my husbands phone who still has a contract with Vodafone, I couldn't use my phone anymore since I was no longer a customer of theirs. I went through the whole rigmarole of explaining the situation again. The lady at CS, I just couldn't understand what she was saying, her accent was so strong and she was trying to speak English with an American twang which was so bad. She said nothing had been reported about my earlier conversation from the day before. She said she had requested and MCK code and it could take 10 days. Now, 12 days later, I still have no phone to use and still awaiting the MCK code from Vodafone. My issue is obvious, yet customer services at Vodafone asked me to give them another chance and asked me to stay with Vodafone.  Like hell I will! I even went to the Vodafone shop, the manager didn't have a clue and wanted me put of the shop as quick as possible.  He came and spoke to me at the door, I hadn't even stepped in. He could have said that he'd ring customer services and help me sort out the problem.  Frustrating,  infuriated and angry are only some words I'm allowed to use.  Keep away from Vodafone, they're very quick to take your money and are constantly hiking prices up within your contract. But dare you wanting to leave.

Vodafone needs to change how it trains its staff, what it writes in the T&Cs for orders and what advice customer service teams give as well as Vodafone franchise stores: as my experience was wholly sub-standard coming from a corporate brand like Vodafone. I happen to also be the account manager for a business account, so my personal retail experience here will massively dent our ongoing business relationship. You really need to sort out your act.Note: I resolved this matter myself by calling through to customer service 5 times, eventually bypassing your not so secure security (as staff aren't all trained same) and armed with my account number (which had never been supplied to me) I was finally able to request a refund (but time will tell whether the refund finds its way back to my card).",Jaggers007,2021,9,4,1,0.051,0.054,Positive

Of which I knew nothing about otherwise I would have vigorously challenged thi. I had no opportunity to do so. I contacted Vodafone and they stated they would sort it out. I explained they should not have sold my personal details as it was against the former Data Protection Act. Vodafone stated as a customer they can share my details with others. I'm not a customer and you can't share my details! I contacted the CEO Nick Jeffery and he assured me it would be dealt with. Hes like a tit in a trance. He then gave the complaint to his Directors Office and i then got an email... ""sorry you've had reason to complain blah blah"".. Please sign into your account using this unique code number. I can't lig in to an account as I'm not a bloody customer.. This went on for over a year. Kept getting usual fob off letters. I made a complaint to Ofcom and Vodafones mediator and guess what......

I got that fed up i wrote a Pre Prorocol letter outlining my complaint before I proceed to Court. Vodafones ne solicitors had the three month obligatory time to answer my complaint but guess what it's now some 5 months and nothing. I then wrote to Nick Jeffery informing him I've still yet to hear from his legal team. Again no response.

Every conversation ends with the promise that the line will be up and running within 12-24 hours and that we'll receive a call back. Nothing happens. We've spoken to Vodafone almost every day for the past week and every day they promise the same thing - and then fail to deliver).

There’s the most common form of abuse as the form of elder abuse. I have experienced this kind of offence in several occasions myself. I have also observed this behaviour towards any other customers for numerous times. It’s devastating to the customers and is frequently traced to some ways of financial abuse. On August 31, 2021, I came to the noted above location requesting to provide me with the information regarding a raised up payment for the next month. Marina who called herself as the director of the store refused to let me know where I can obtain this information. She called me “unstable” and invited her coworker to offend me as well.

1093,Avoid Vodafone like the plague,"Avoid Vodafone like the plague! Where do I start? 1. The broadband speed was significantly below the 'guaranteed minimum' speed. When I phoned customer service, they passed me round various different departments and, after four infuriating hour-long phone conversations when I was passed from one department to another, they concluded it was not their fault so they would continue to charge the same price.2. When my daughter's mobile contract came to an end, the fee doubled and the contract auto-renewed without any notifications from Vodafone to ask if that's what I wanted. The same happened to my sister. 3. Leaving Vodafone is an absolute nightmare. They gave me every reason under the sun as to why they could not supply me with a PAC code. Surely this is quite a frequent request and not worthy of an hour's phone call, again being passed around from department to department.4. Today, Vodafone provided me with an NUC code so I could unlock the phone they sold me and use it with a different (really straightforward) network. Acquiring the NUC code was like being on a quest for the Holy grail, (but not as exciting). When it eventually arrived, it is the wrong one and does not work. If I type in the wrong code more than four times, the phone will go into a 'hard lock' and I have to send it off to the factory for a reset. I contacted Vodafone, (another ridiculously long phone call), who have promised they will send out a new code. I am not holding out much hope. They are a very sneaky and shameless company who smack 'admin fees' on for anything you do, especially when you're trying to leave.Do not use Vodafone unless you are trialling a new anger suppressant drug and need a scenario that will put it to the test!",Bridie Walker,2021,8,31,1,0.086,0.049,Negative

The people on the chat were courteous albeit their one word per minute typing speed. The fact that I was transferred to three separate teams without resolving my issue is pretty indicative of their incompetency.The obscene price tag that hangs over their services is as much an overestimate of their abilities as well as an insult to their users.To the Vodafone team on here saying to contact their Facebook page: please don't reply to this review.

And after a forty five minute wait allowed myself to be persuaded to take out a new contract with another phone.HUGE MISTAKE.First I got cut off half way through the process which necessitated another forty minute wait to get back to them.Then they checked to see if the new phone was available for me to pick up from King’s Road and it was.So I went straight down to the shop to pick it up and after another forty five minute wait, followed by much photocopying and checking of my ID, it wasn’t there!So back to square one after rudely and aggressively being told off by the “manager” for talking in a “too loud” voice - which other customers could overhear.Back home for another forty five minutes waiting to be connected to customer services. Apparently there’s no way you can just pick up the phone from another store. The whole contract has to be cancelled and you have to start all over again.So SIM only for me from now on and no more rip off deals. And not with Vodafone if I can help it. It’s been twenty years now and the service just gets worse and worse including the King’s Road store which seems to habitually treat their customers with utter contempt.

But it was resolved, and a goodwill payment promised as well which I’m hoping gets credited but no reason to suggest it won’t. Broadband speeds are good, slightly up on my sky contract I’ve just left. And as for mobile, I’ve been with them a year now and not had 1 issue.

Still not got internet and Vodafone support have made every step of the way as painful as possible.Purchased the superfast fibre 2, obviously for the direct fibreline I needed permission from the freeholder of the property. I spoke to someone on livechat and someone over the phone, both told me that everything is there already and engineer will help set it up. Cityfibre turn up and can't do anything as I don't have permission and couldn't get permission. So I return to livechat to be told to cancel the current contract, find out who supplied the coppier line previous and then swap to the FTTC line. I find out vodafone supplied the line previously, I call the cancellations and get nice lady but for the mobile cancellations she can't pass me onto homebroadband because I don't have 5 security questions and reccomends I go into a vodafone shop to get my pin reset ( I know my pin) I call back and get through to the right department (the automated system is diabolically bad) they cancel the line and tell me to contact livechat the next day to setup the FTTC line. I spend 2 hours on livechat with an agent, for a setup date of the 10th ( I already have the router and the line is working) Have to send back the old router and get a new one. I never get a confirmation email or anything and opt to call the sales team a few hours later. Only to be told Vodafone don't supply to my area and no active line on my account. I manage to explain slowly and get to the right department 20minutes later, get the line setup with a friendly gentlemen for an install of the 14th. I first ordered broadband on the 12th August. Just one thing after another. Extremely frustrating and now I'm tied in for 24months when I know full well support are a joy to deal with. Big mistake.Plus I can't even access my account.Edit: I don't have twitter or facebook, just a little disappointed that despite the review and utilising the complaints line, I've not even had anyone check up on the fact I spent 2.5 hours on livechat to purchase one of your products, I agreed to the terms, put my bank details in for the directdebit and yet when I called up a few hours later there is no record of this happening and now have to wait another 4days on top of the 2 weeks for the second setup date.

This was provided but didn't work, sent another and this didn't work either, then was told I need an MCK code and this would be provided. MCK code never arrived, and I was then told the phone wasn't locked and I didn't need an unlock code!! The phone is 100% locked so I do and, in any case, would you have sent me 2 codes if it wasn't locked (Clueless). All this took months and hours on the phone to the useless call centre. Eventually I asked for some compensation as clearly, they didn't know what they were doing, and I couldn't face wasting a minute more of my time with them. I asked for compensation as I'd now have to try get the phone unlocked by people that know what they're doing. The only compensation they'll give is ""product""!

It cannot be OK for Vodafone to make mistakes and expect the customer to end a long phone call without any confirmed fix, or for me to have to make yet more effort and waste yet more time sorting out their mess!

They then said that there was a problem with our details and we had to re order. No mention of the previous excuse of network problems. We called again to re order only to be told that we have to contact city fibre and get permission for them to do something to our line. What an absolute farce.

As you can imagine I have contacted Vodafone numerous times only to be put through to Egypt again and no one can reconnect me. All I hear is it’s an open order and it will take another 48 hrs.

Sometimes it keeps showing 5G, but there's none of that.When you contact the costumer service they say there's a problem in your area.

They want to lock you into a contract without giving you nothing, so to suck your money for 12-24 months.**EDIT**Your response is misleading like everything your company does. Indeed Voxi and Vodafone share the same connectivity, what you don't say is that Voxi is much cheaper and requires no contract. You should instead explain how can I get the same as I got with Voxi for double the price and a contract that is only useful for you to take as much money offering nothing but frustration.

I was shocked to the core. I have my phone here but barely use it & pay almost £40 for the privilege.I called them to discuss. First advisor told me it was a SCAM text but on a follow-up call told that this was not the case. My extreme usage was in June & amounted to 200 minutes, 8 texts & as they said, a tiny amount of data. I took the tariff as a business user & checked it was appropriate for European use. They agree that I use minimal amounts of everything but now they're going to use an ""Acceptable Use Policy"" to try to cheat & charge me! Have you ever heard of this? How is 200 minutes & 8 texts & a tiny amount of data classed as EXTREME.Finally they send a link to this unheard of policy. Just disgusting that companies hide these so even their staff have never heard of them. Still no idea where a CUSTOMER can find this or why business account managers know nothing about it.

1191,No working phone. No service. No refund. - My 2 month nightmare with Vodafone Norwich (Chantry Place),"2 months ago I took out a new contract with Vodafone Norwich after telling my old provider I was leaving, was all good when I ordered my phone in store as they gave me a deal and promised in store delivery. Service was good, until the phone arrived that’s when the 2 months of issues begun.My SIM card was not activating for nearly a month, after going into store about 10 times only to be told the same story that my account was not activated properly that they will do ‘requests’ to get it done, they were very casual about such a major issue which isn’t really professional. After trying a second SIM, not surprisingly nothing worked. And money was taken out of my account despite my phone not being activated, now going against what I signed for. The first month came and still no working phone, so they went to get a new one but wanted me to pay another upfront cost! Which is ridiculous as I already paid upfront and that Vodafone as a company let me down for a month! So I made the right decision to cancel my contract. So they put in yet another ‘request’ to send my refund over, and strangely refused to give me a receipt of refund. I went away with 2 reference numbers which I demanded and had to fight for. I got 1 refund out of 2 but Vodafone were not giving me my upfront! I went into store another 3 times for about an hour each for them to make a conclusion of… doing yet another ‘request’. Now a month after cancelling I was still waiting for my full refund, and Vodafone Norwich have now broken Trading Standards at this point and going over the 15 days in which they are given from the day of refund to give me my money back. After countless trips back and forth, they finally got my refund… by doing it in store which should have been done from the beginning instead of wasting my time and passing the issue to other employees! I must have spoken to each member, and not gotten anywhere. Even some trying to turn me away from the door and go online!!! Where is the customer service? Even going into store, a terrible system along with underwhelming customer service was not getting this issue sorted in good time.I am not impressed with the overall customer service, and their poor behaviour towards a major issue which took just over 2 months to get sorted! Even speaking and seeing other people have issues with Vodafone and this branch, I will certainly not be returning and ensuring that myfriends, family and acquaintances do not use this provider and this store. Glad it’s now sorted, but it should not have taken this long. I now left Vodafone without a phone or refund for 2 months, now wasting time looking for a new phone!

Kept calling and informed of extended dates of maintenance even though my wife not affected as a Vodafone user.

They said ""3-5"" days. She was told someone would call to let her know when it would be collected. 3 days pass...call never comes. She phones up and they tell her to take it to the vodaphone shop and they will send it. Okay, fine. She encounters a rude customer service person at the shop who does not give her any information other than it will take ""3-5"" days. Again, 5 days pass, she has heard nothing from them. So she calls again. The phone has still not even arrived at the repair centre. Apparently it takes ""3-5"" days to just get to the repair centre and then a further 5-10 days to be repaired then another 3-5 days to be repaired! Considering you can get this service done in the same day, 4 weeks is madness. But, they have her phone (wherever it is) so she waits. They said they would call her to talk to her before they repair it. So she checks the tracking app everyday and it still only says ""repair booked"" until yesterday where suddenly it's jumped forward to saying they apparently tried to call her the week before (they didn't) and that the phone is now being sent back (3-5 days) UNREPAIRED.

It seems it is impossible to connect to a human being at Vodafon at present to sort out a problem, unless you want to buy something, or your problem falls into the limited knowledge base of that LEGO idiot TOBI.Whichever direction you go in you feel trapped in a Kafkaesque circle of Hell where you always end up with TOBI’s idiot smiling face asking you for the question he can’t answer.

From there it was sent for repair (without the back of the phone or battery). A week later the handset was returned saying there was nothing wrong with it!  Lo and behold it still wouldn't charge up. So I spoke to someone on chat who booked another repair and said this time I should sent the battery and back of the phone too. Well, duh! Don't know why it wasn't sent like that in the first place! So after a week of repairs the phone has come back today with a covering letter saying they have sent me a new handset because it couldn't be fixed.

My upgrade remains stuck “in the back office” and as my service isn’t impacted I’m not a priority.

Eventually I made myself understood and the fault was reported to Openreach and an engineer visit was arranged. A week later the fault was traced to a cable fault under the road outside. Three weeks later I was told by Vodaphone via txt that the fault was fixed but it wasn't and I still had no broadband. Today 31st July After 15 minutes I got through to India or some other far flung place to explain that the broadband was still not working, the agent said it might be fixed next week and they would let me know when.

Excuse me, but have I not already paid a lump amount in advance for a service until the credit runs out. Why was I not told that they were going to delete my number.

1295,1 star is too good for Voda-theft,"1 star is too good for Voda-theft! Warning to all customers they are con artists. I've been a customer for over 10 years, but V have really outdone themselves for being the worst company I have ever dealt with. I had 3 contract phones & 1 tablet with them. My phone & tablet, my boyfriend's phone & my daughter's phone all being paid from my direct debit account. However, when I decided to add seperate direct debit account details for the 2 other phones the problems started. The first month after I made the change via their app (rubbish app that clearly doesn't work) they collected the full amount as usual from my d/d account. I explained via call that I wanted my daughter's bill & boyfriend's bill to be paid via the separate d/d details provided by me. They assured me it was done ready for the next bill. But sadly they hadn't. Next month's bill was then taken from my boyfriend's d/d account. I arranged to do a private bank transfer of mine & my daughter's bill to him & contacted V to ask how this had happened. They gave no reasonable explanation but continued to advise me it would be sorted by next bill. However, the errors just kept coming. The following month they decided to not collect payment & sent a text to my boyfriend to say they couldn't take payment, even though they had 3 direct debit account details on file. I rang them straight away & offered to pay mine & my daughter's bill including the tablet & left my boyfriends bill to be collected via his d/d account. However, they took a double payment from my daughter's account not once but twice. I called them up & complained asking for a refund, when they tried to say that it was an advance payment...WHAT!!! They eventually refunded the money after explaining several times I had already paid her bill via my debit card. A day later my boyfriend contacts me to say he can't use his phone to call out. I get on the phone to ask why his bill is still showing outstanding on the account & why his phone has been restricted. No one can give me a sensible answer. Although they did say that the bill showing is for Aug even though we're still in July...ridiculous! I then notice they've taken another amount via my d/d account, so now I've paid them twice in the same month (July) except the amount is slightly more. I speak to 3 different people trying to get answers & no one has any clue what is going on. Whilst I'm waiting to speak with their Complaints Dept. I notice that my daughter's bill for the Aug month has had additional charges added, increasing her tariff by an extra £13 & some pence. I tell the call handler & request my refund & ask what these additional charges are for. He replies he will investigate it. Later on that evening I notice that my tablet tariff has also been increased with additional charges under the heading of other...! I'm so angry I'm lost for words at the blatant way Vodafone think they can get away with adding charges for no reason & taking money that is not owed to them. And we, the customer has to fight to get our money back. I'm cancelling all my contracts with them asap, they will not get another penny from me. NEVER EVER deal with them, their service team haven't got a clue what they're talking about & nothing ever gets resolved. I've spoken to about 7 different persons regarding this issue over the d/d accounts & 3 of them was just in 1 day. They even tried to tell me that I was paying more on a pro rata basis because I changed the bank details...DOES ANYONE THERE UNDERSTAND WHAT PRO RATA MEANS?...CLEARLY NOT! If you make changes to a service plan or a policy cover which alters the premium part way through your contract etc, THEN the premium is recalculated on a pro rata basis & you either pay the difference or the premium is reduced to reflect the changes. OMGOSH!!! Vodafone you are training your staff to talk nonsense to the customers but unfortunately we are a bit more clued up than you realise.

1314,Avoid if you travel abroad,"On the 8th of July I left the UK on vacation. The moment I crossed the border to Ireland, I lost my ability to send and receive text and calls. I also lost my ability to use my mobile data. On the 13th of July I contacted Vodafone through Live Support.. I had already tried everything, but tried everything again. We reconfigured my APN, switched to 2G, turned my phone on and off, re-provisioned my sim card and much more. Finally, after approximately 1 hour 30 minutes the representative tells me to restart my phone again. While restarting my phone, the representative initiated his/hers ""exit call sequence"" knowing fully well that I was in the process of restarting my phone. Thankfully I managed to get online before they ended the call with me, but this is deeply unprofessional. In the end, the representative was not able to fix my issue. They simply shrugged and told me to wait a few hours. The next day I called Vodafone to follow up regarding my issue. In the first session, after waiting 45 minutes for help, I was finally contacted.. but after being put on hold 3 times, the operator hung up on me. I called again, waited another 45 minutes, and did not receive any help yet again. I asked if Vodafone would refund me for big value bundle, and they answered no. I asked if Vodafone would be willing to cover me buying a sim card in Norway (where I was) but I was also told no. I asked to speak to a manager, they told me a manager would call me within 24 hours (on a different number, my phone didn't work) but I never received a call. In the end this was highly disruptive to my vacation, I was stuck 16 days without 2 factor authentication to access critical work functions and my bank. I could not receive nor send calls or text messages.I contacted them again on the 26th of July 2021, where I was told that they will not offer me a refund nor cover any of my expenses, and the best they could do is refund my 10 pound big value bundle as credit. I was denied a refund to my bank account.If you are travelling abroad and want to ensure you have coverage to call, text, and to use internet, I would avoid Vodafone. They did not admit fault, the customer support was awful, and from my experience, they do not care about their customers.

I told them under the consumer rights act they at this point must replace it. The tried saying the promised this would be the last time which just sounded patronising.I then spent 2 and a half hours on the phone to their complaints department who said it was in their policy.

1321,Clearly not the only one...,"Honestly, the worst experience I have ever had with a service. Everything was substandard. I was with Vodaphone for a year on a PAYG basis. I have no idea why I didn't switch sooner. I had so, so many daily issues with the network. My top ups sometimes didn't register and I had to send over screenshots of my bank statements; the service regularly stopped working between 1am and 8am, where I was unable to make calls, etc. when I had plenty of credit or the promotions wouldn't reactivate; I lost work through my texts and calls being deactivated on occasions during the day, also. Even though I live in an area with supposedly good signal, my internet on my phone was horrendously inconsistent. I had to call daily and the customer service is like nothing I have ever experienced. I was regularly put on hold for very long periods of time, cut off, told I was lying-even when I provided all evidence and conversations would often just go around in circles, where I was constantly repeating myself. There seemed to be regular communication barriers. They would try to make me go through this setting 'fix' every phone call and it never worked. Credit seemed to disappear also, during periods were I was unable to use the service! It was just awful. It raised my blood pressure through the roof. I eventually decided that I wanted my call records so I could make a formal complaint, and they refused. They advised that if I wanted these, then I would need to go in to a Vodaphone store. I did, and I was told that they couldn't retrieve these records and to call the customer services. I calmly and politely explained the issue and they just tried to hurry me out of the store- out of ear shot of other customers. It was a constant stressful experience trying to speak to the correct department. They used to send these customer feedback questionnaires, and even though I filled them in the same day (twice seconds after receiving), they would simply reply with 'Sorry, this questionnaire has expired'. I suspect this is how they manage to claim positive customer satisfaction, as they simply disregard negative ones. They also used to send messages saying 'You need to have topped up at least £10 from the start of the service to be eligible for this promotion', when I was topping up ridiculous amounts and had been with them for ages. When I asked for missing credit to be put back on, they acted like they were doing me a favour or treated me like I was just trying to get freebies! You have to ask yourself why all of the most affordable PAYG phone's are with Vodafone. It's one of the ways they rope people in. Pay £10 to get the phone unlocked and you will save yourself a lot more in the long run! Totally horrible network.

Complete gibberish and 2 of the 8 I could barely understand due to accents and poor grasp of English. So after 4 hours, 1 complaint and Vodafone telling me that I cannot buy through a 3rd party provider like uswitch or Carphone Warehouse AND keep my existing number on a Vodafone contract. I need to leave Vodafone or accept this awful treatment. How's that for customer retention?

Great I thought! 12 days later the txt arrived saying ever was fixed. Brilliant I thought, until I tried to run a speed test. No 4G at all. Best was 3G. Then still poor.

Pleased to say I've been able to cancel with Vodafone (finally) and received a refund (albeit after having to deal with a particularly smug manager who advised they wouldn't offer money which was previously offered, only credit to my account) - after requesting the address to send a Deadlock letter before submitting a formal complaint to ombudsman, their online customer service representatives managed to issue a refund with 2 days (so, apparently not impossible as I'd previously been told) In any event, if you want something relatively simple like activating a sim card and porting a number from another network, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Vodafone are not able to do this - there's a reason they consistently rank bottom in customer service (it's a crowded field, but they managed to surpass even Virgin Mobile in dreadful performance)",Burt Daniels,2021,7,11,1,0.078,0.079,Positive

As a small business owner with 11 phone lines on the account, they make it very difficult to get any help at all when you need it (even to take out more lines). They don't want to speak to you and do everything possible - via their awful automated lines - to punt you off to a web chat, FAQ, or anything which means they won't have to actually speak to you and provide a service. Webchats are ridiculously long winded and the waiting times for calls are terrible. Expect to waste an hour of your time if getting in contact.Add in the despicable sneaky charges which get bolted on to your account even when you expressly ask them not to be (for Securenet). They cut off one of lines in February in error and when they were asked to reconnect it, they started the contract again (and started charging us for securenet again). The line should now be out of contract, but they are now claiming it is not out of contract because it was connected in February! I've raised 2 complaints about this and weeks later have had zero updates. I'm currently on the phone to them while writing this (1hr and 2 mins so far) and it's quite obvious they have no idea about the complaint!It appears that when you enter into a contract with Vodafone, you are obliged to uphold your side of the bargain; i.e. paying bills on time, but they aren't obliged to uphold any minimum level of customer service. You, as the customer are just required to suffer whatever standards they wish to offer (or not). When the service becomes so unbearable that you need to change providers, they'll gladly charge you excessive cancellation fees for the pleasure of having suffered them. They clearly have no regard for their reputation and the lost revenues they must suffer through the terrible customer reviews. I'll certainly do my best to make sure as many people on as many sites as possible are aware of what they will be facing if they are thinking of using Vodafone.539. That's the number of minutes spent on the phone with Vodafone in 2021 so far, sorting out issues which they've caused! And that's before I just discovered that once again they haven't cancelled one of the lines we asked to be cut off ages ago and we're still being charged. Would strongly urge any business owner who values their own time and some simple customer service to stay away. Will be moving all of our lines to another provider.",Aaron Goodrum,2021,7,8,1,0.112,0.082,Negative

I would avoid any interaction with this company and its poorly trained/equipped staff. Find a less stressful way to spend your time and money.Update: my last complaint was that Vodafone hadn't recorded my cancellation.

1458,Worst company ever - avoid like the plague,This company is by far the worse company I have ever had dealings with. All I wanted to do was close an account on behalf of my mother ( a lady who is in a nursing home with severe dementia). All she had with them was a mobile wifi device which was for her old room when she moved into residential care. At the time of purchase my mother was mentally with it and her name was solely on the account and then unfortunately she deteriorated over 5-6 years. Recently I asked Vodophone to close the account back in May and explained i had proof of POA etc and I was happy to send them all the information I needed. 3 MONTHS LATER the account still hasn't been closed and now they have the cheek to ask my mother for more money even knowing they have drawn out this process themselves which has put my mother into those arrears. I was passed from pillar to post both on the phone and on the online chat with advisors who had no idea how to deal with what I was simply asking for and the company's procedures dealing with POA related stuff is very poor! Phone lines constantly saying they are busy when they clearly aren't and trying to fob customers off to online resources instead of talking to real human beings. They kept saying I hadn't sent photo ID or POA documents which I had done on several occasions and the chat advisor who gave me the e mail to send the documents to turned out to be a complaints line instead - this wasn't a bad thing but it was annoying all the same.....again the incompetence surrounding this isn't a surprise. I will NEVER recommend this company to any of my friends/ family or even my worse enemies if they have had to endure the 3 months I have had to deal with.

They are....A #### company, non-existent processes, poor technology, poor customer service and the ethics of complete dog####.The only way to fix this company is to remove their useless pos CEO and to rip the organisation to pieces.I well never EVER touch them again.

They say the phone is already unlocked...it is not.Now they advise me to go to a third party to unlock my phone and they will refund the cost.This whole process has been unnecessarily difficult and shown a really inept side of Vodafone process, leading me to question if it's slow to encourage people to give up and stay with Vodafone",Ryan Reed,2021,7,5,2,0.02,0.079,Positive

I’ve spent a total of 17 hours on the phone and in the shop. The call centres in India and Egypt are utterly clueless. The people there cannot deal with anything as complicated as this and just kept passing me around. Their English was dreadful and had no idea how their own procedures worked with Open Reach in the UK. So Vodafone outsource installation and kept saying it wasn’t their fault! Three months on we still don’t have broadband!! This is the worst customer service I’ve ever received.Update: I left Vodafone. When I did they decided to offer compensation. The sum of £1 for each day of no connection. According to Ofcom they should have paid £5.04 per day.

I called them to report this as their website boasted an excellent signal in the area, their solution was for me to purchase a signal booster, I had to threaten to change network (when contract was due for renewal) to get a free one, which turned out to be a plug-in WiFi connection for my phone…other networks have this option built into the handset so no need for any additional expense. My work phone which is EE has this function and it works better than the expensive device that Vodafone push onto their already paying customers.They also boast loyalty schemes which are just ways to get you to spend even more money through their partners. In order to get value for money from them, you have to shout and stomp your feet which just isn’t my style any more and is in no way a show of loyalty to their customers. I won’t stomp my feet any more, I will just vote with them, which is why after giving them my loyalty for almost a decade, after trying over and over to get a reasonable deal from them, giving them the opportunity to match other suppliers offers, I am walking away and am doubtful that I will walk back any time soon.I feel that fact that they do not appear to reply to the negative feedback on a review site as influential as this one, tells you everything you need to know about their opinion of their customers.",Jonathan Swift,2021,7,2,2,0.038,0.124,Positive

Over 3 hours on phone, two trips to the local branch who stated they were ""fed up"" with customer services making people leave!!!  Eventually couldn't get anywhere and was told contract ended in two month and £34 to pay to end contract so went to O2 and got fantastic service and a new, cheaper phone and contract, within 30 mins.  Was told by Vodafone shop in Livingston to call a number to get the code to transfer the number and when we got home we called and argued with a person who could barely speak English that despite passing security they had to send a code - yes to the phone that was damaged and the sim wasn't working!!  Eventually spend half an hour arguing only to be told she could answer other questions, passed these and told the PUC code would be - yes you quessed it - to the phone and sim that wasn't working!!  Also said they now wanted £80 despite my having an online chat with the lower figure from yesterday which I saved.  Then they hung up on us when we said for the 100th time it wasn't working and just wanted them to give it to us.  The lady was in tears and I am now preparing a Scottish Simple Court procedure claim against Vodafone on her behalf as this is utterly outrageous.

1507,Just switched to Vodafone,"Just switched to Vodafone. Big mistake. For starters I wasn't able to port in my number from Three. I was in long chats with incompetent support staff, not knowing what to do until I said I want to cancel the contract with Vodafone. I was just about to do so after speaking to their returns team but suddenly they managed to do the transfer, the old sim stopped working and I figured out the new one is functional. Later I wanted to pick one of the entertainment offers as per contract. Amazon prime was my choice. I couldn't get it as every time when I tried I got an error message, ""oops something went wrong, please try again"". Gone again in long chats with incompetent support staff. They messed up in such a manner that at some point they claimed I subscribed to Spotify instead of Amazon. I told them that's impossible first because Spotify is still an option to be picked in my offers from Vodafone, secondly because I would never pick Spotify since I got Apple Music for ages. Then they said they need to upgrade the systems and to get back later. Which I did. Then they said my account PIN is not working, basically that I don't know my PIN account. They probably changed my account PIN as I didn't and I wouldn't do that. I pay for a service I can't get it, I got a lot of hassle from Vodafone and I didn't get any compensation. In addition the support staff are spending my time, keeping me for hours online. I spent all day yesterday chatting with Vodafone support staff. I'm really willing to contact the relevant ombudsman as I feel cheated and degraded by a band of scammers. I regret very much I left Three who are such a nice guys and helpful for a band of scammers.

I was passed from dept to dept and person to person, each promising to help, only to have to start all over again at the next call. I finally asked to leave and terminate the contract early and they said they would not charge an early exit fee if I gave up any legal recourse and stopped chasing for the undelivered handset (and the refund for over-paying a plan which should have included the handset).

We paid without having a clarification.I used to have EE as my broadband, Vodafone again called me offering another great discount and I have switched to Vodafone.We agreed £19.99 but then they charged me £30 pound.The broadband contract I have with Vodafone states that when ever I move they gonna transfer to my new address without paying nothing. I have moved and told them my new address.They gave me an appointment, I was waiting the whole day , I called them when I become impatient and surprisingly they Told me that they have forgotten my appointment which is absurd.I contacted them again and they apologised and surprisingly they sent the engineer to my old address.After all of this , they told me I need to have another new contact by force which I don’t agree with them.Till now I don’t have internet, almost 4 weeks have gone by without internet,  I got children who study at home , and imagine having no internet in this pandemic.While all of this happening I have paid any amount that was due.By Abdulahi",Abdullahi A,2021,6,17,1,0.041,0.085,Positive

The best she could tell me was that it's ""the government"" and that ""they are working on it"", but nothing definitive or conclusive.She said I therefore had to email the Support Desk (apparently she couldn't just transfer this, nor even provide me with the Reference # for the call, and she didn't even have the relevant email address to hand)!So, I'm emailing now, but am not hopeful!I just wish I had paid more attention to the reviews before buying - I had seen others say support was bad, but figured it couldn't be *that* bad, and in any case, it's not like I needed support for my previous provider, so why would that be an issue?

1609,Unfortunately you cannot give no stars.,"Unfortunately you cannot give no stars.8 years ago I had Virgin Media phone and Broadband.7 years ago I switched to Sky for TV, Phone and Broadband5 years ago I switched to BT for Phone and Broadband3 years ago I switched to Vodafone for Phone and BroadbandEvery time I was able to port by number between providers.When CityFibre became available in my area I thought I would take advantage of the super fast Fibre to the House broadband, so called to upgrade.Everything was fine, until I asked about retaining my number, when I was told, oh no, you can't retain your number, it will have to be a new one.At that point I said that cannot be right, but the agent was adamant that I could not retain my number.I asked to speak to their manager, to be told they do not have a manager.I asked to be put through to complaints, to be told they cannot transfer calls.I called complaints, who told me, no of course you can keep your number.  They transfer me back to another agent, who says yes, I can transfer your number, and takes my order.  I am given an installation date, and I then take great efforts to arrange a day off work for that install.Days later, I get a call saying my order has been cancelled because they couldn't transfer my number, and asking me if I would like to re-place the order.I of course say yes, but they then say then cannot install until more than a week later than the date I had gone to great lengths to take off work.I am of course not happy with this, the order is cancelled and I revert back to complaints.I query why the number cannot be retained, and am told it is because the new service is provided by CityFibre and the old service was provided by OpenReach.  I have never heard such a lame excuse.  That's like saying that EDF Energy cannot supply your electricity because the cables to the house were installed by British Gas!  It's the same electricity, it's just who bills it that changes!!!!Long story short, after much too and fro, another order is placed, explicitly specified as being without the transfer of the old number, and everything seems to be fine, until. . . .Days before the install I get another call, my landline cannot be transferred, do I still want to continue with the order?With this I lose it!  There was not number transfer on this order.  Why the heck are you calling me to tell me you cannot transfer my number?  Just go ahead with the install as agreed.I again query the reasons why this alleged landline transfer that I didn't request this time wasn't successful, and am told that now it's because the number is a Virgin Media number, yet Vodafone already supply it to me.  It's a transfer to themselves!!!Minutes later I get texts and emails saying my order has been cancelled, and then thank you for your order.  They've cancelled my order and re-ordered it again!!!!!So, my broadband is installed.  My old landline phone enters a disconnected state, but I get my bill, and low and behold, they're charging me for my new service, and my old service that I cannot use!!!!!Over the few days of using the new Gigafast Broadband, which is supposed to be 900Mb/s, I am consistenly only getting 300Mb/s to 400Mb/s on a Gigabit Ethernet connection.  I check the router logs and note that Vodafone are sending instructions to my router to open up firewall ports for the phone service.I decide that if Vodafone can issue instructions to my router's firewall, that is a huge security risk for me, working from home on highly confidential data (my profession is as a Data Protection Practitioner, holding a recognised legal qualification to advise on data protection law).I replace Vodafone's router with my own hardware that I know is secure.  Wow, I now get 900Mb/s or more consistently, so Vodafone's hardware was not only insecure, but also slowing my connection.But, now the phone service doesn't work because to use the phone service, you have to use Vodafone's hardware.I ask for the VOIP settings to configure my own VOIP hardware, which after much to and fro, Vodafone reluctantly provide, but . . .The addresses they give for their VOIP server(s) do not resolve to reachable servers, so cannot be communicated with.Vodafone refuse to provide the details to use the service that frankly I did not want in the first place because I could not keep my number.On top of that, I am locked into a contract which increases the package price by some £6 per month for the privilege of having a call package that I cannot use.Vodafone claim that the phone service is free, but it's not.  If you buy Gigafast Pro they charge you for calls.  If you buy Gigafast Pro Xtra, the calls are included but the price goes up, otherwise the service is the same, so how is the call package free??Do yourself a favour, avoid Vodafone at all costs.

1614,Beware of cancelling,"I was with vodafone for 3/4 years, I had a sim only contract and paid every single bill on time. I cancelled in December as was moving to EE. I called vodafone up and they said they’d cancel everything and that all was good. I received nothing in writing to confirm that the cancellation had been actioned but the guy on the phone said it was all done. I had no further payments come out from my bank and could see that the direct debit was cancelled. Over 6 months later I received a letter through the post saying vodafone have referred my name to a debt collection agency as I didn’t pay my last bill. I contacted vodafone straight away to settle this and questioned why is this the first I’ve heard about owing money? They claimed they emailed me when they tried to take the money but they were lying. I asked for proof of this email and they claimed they can’t provide me with this proof as it’s from an automated emailing system. After me calling their bluff, as I check my emails daily and never had anything from them. It then turned out they sent me an sms message to the same sim that I cancelled and haven’t used for over 6 months! I’m in the process of sorting this out and I paid the bill straight away (as I would’ve if they informed me when it first happened) but I’m now trying to clear my name with the debt collection service Ardent Credit as I’m applying for mortgages currently and this has completely messed the process up! What a nightmare and beware if you’re cancelling because this is how they treat you if you switch to a competitor. No contact to say you’ve got an outstanding payment until 6 months later, then you receive a debt collectors letter saying you’ve got a default against your name and saying you won’t be able to take out loans etc. Disgusting customer service. And to top it off they lie to you claiming they emailed you when they didn’t then admit they texted an expired / cancelled number. What a joke of a company!

1640,Scamming Robbing Company,"I thought I would write a review on my experience with Vodafone recently to warn others but upon reading the reviews already left I can see they are already less than popular. So I had a two year contract with them and always paid my bill on time every month, I decided to not continue my contract when it ended as I can’t really afford it anymore and got a giffgaff sim as it would be a lot cheaper. So I call up Vodafone a month before my contract ends and tell them I don’t want it to roll over when it ends, the girl on the phone tells me the ONLY way I can do this is to call up a few days before it’s end date and request a PAC code to which I replied “Are you sure because last time I just called up to let you guys know not to roll it over and disconnect my phone, plus I don’t even want to keep my number” but she was adamant this is what I had to do. Still unsure a week later I went into an actual store and they said I can cancel it but it will take 30 days to disconnect and they assured me I had already paid my 24th months bill. I did not use the phone past the 8th May but they are now charging me until the beginning of June when my contract ended on the 18th May. Their communication and information is so so poor and due to their faults I am now getting emails saying I still owe £48! When I haven’t even used the sim, the only way you can actually get through to speak to someone over the phone is if you say you want to upgrade, if you say you have a dispute or problem the automated voice just tells you to go online 🙈 This whole experience with Vodafone has left me having sleepless nights and having a breakdown. I requested an investigation into the phone call from the girl I first spoke to and the end result (I had to chase them up) was that I had requested a PAC code which is completely untrue so they are lying. I have now requested a recording of this phone call. Just avoid the stress and go with someone else, they have completely ripped me off and if they carry on this way more and more people will refuse to use their services. They reduced the final bill to £30 and for now I have just payed it to avoid more stress but I feel like I have been robbed.",Lauren,2021,6,11,1,0.101,0.038,Negative
1641,Horrible experience,"Horrible experience! Not recommend at all!I first received at home an advertisement from Vodafone saying that they now provide fiber at my house. I checked on their website and they do provide fiber at my current address.I then spent 2 hours (2 hours!) on the phone in order to pass on all subscription details - if it was an online form it would have been 5 mins. The day of delivery of the router we found out they registered the wrong address and sent it to another one! Got in contact with DPD first, and then with Vodafone for then realising they don't have my address house registered in their system! After having received the ad letter at home and checked on their website...So the router was sent to another address, other waste of time and canceled subscription. Few days later I receive a letter saying that I have to return the router (which I didn't receive!). I go to the wrong address and realise they returned the router to DPD. I try to contact Vodafone to explain the situation but because my contract was canceled they are not able to identify me (even more waste of time).And now I realise that all of this had even impacted my credit score, after being so much patient after dealing with so much incompetence.I'll dissuade any person I know to get in contact with Vodafone by telling about my horrible experience",Nicholas Tucci,2021,6,11,1,0.08,0.014,Negative

1644,Waste of time and shocking customer service,Asked to switch from SIM only contract to PAYG and they completely disconnected my SIM which resulted in me losing my number to my accounts.  It is important to note that we specified that we wanted to keep the number as we would reactivate the plan when it was actually needed. The whole situation was a shitshow. First we were told that this was a mistake on vodaphones end and that we would have to call back when their buisness team was open so they could authorise reconection. This plan was for a student so i have no clue how this was ever taken out as a buisness plan. When we ring them apparently the pin we used had magically changed in 2 days which resulted in us having to to reset the pin for the account which was a process which took 4 hour call for the information to be given that we then needed to make a trip to the Vodaphone store to carry out the reset. Once this was done we then had to go through another 2 hour call to Vodaphone where they said that the changed pin was incorrect which absolutely blew my mind as we had changed it on the same day. After being transferred and moved to another department they said that the PIN was correct and then put me through to the technical team which gave me steps to carry out and said that the number would be reconnected. Fast forward two days there was still no connection so I went back and asked why this was the case on online chat. Turns out 3 months had passed without contact from when they disconnected my number so they could not reconnect it at all. This was a 3 hour wait just for this information. What this basically means is that because Vodaphone messed up and completely disconnected my number altogether without my knowledge I could not get my number back.

All now resolved but annoying at the time. Broadband is pretty reliable, mobile service is the best for my locations and my two landlines are free so overall a very good price. They focus on dealing through apps which can be frustrating and for a phone company they don’t publish actual phone numbers - curious, but true.

This includes talking to the complaint handlers in the director’s office team. 5-6 hour of this and their insipid hold music and I’m no further forward! I’m told that I need to wait 14 days for a reconnect or could get given a cheap mobile broadband hub. Shame I’ve got no useable signal indoors on their network!  I’ve been given at least 3 different reason why my service was disconnected including a line takeover request from a different service provider.  Ofcom rules state that this must be done with my permission, I was given no warning and hadn’t requested it. The Vodafone directors office case handler started on with the emotional manipulation and guilt tripping. Saying that it wasn’t voda’s fault, I should pursue the other company for compensation (they deny the line takeover request from their side), they were really sorry but they couldn’t offer anything further. I’ve never felt so patronised, manipulated and lied to for years and certainly not by a phone provider. Moreover I’ve still got no internet and no resolution!  Before that I was promised that it’d be fixed in 1-2 days. Thanks but no thanks voda! Honestly this is the absolute worst. FYI the connection speeds were really sh-y.

Not only did they basically refuse to cancel my contract for months, they then never told me they still wanted money after it was cancelled.

During my 24 month contract they were a great company, but between last September/October to now (June) it’s been horrible, but they did take the arrears off saying mistakes were made by them in reference to contacting me about a payment etc. So fair play to Vodafone for doing it.

1719,Being charged double and possibly more due to mix up. (Resolved) thank you for your help javanna.,"So basically (phone 2) contract was meant to end on the 19th march. I upgraded this phone through the vodaphone app and received my upgrade phone (phone 1) After a few weeks I noticed I was being billed double, it came to £60, i usually pay around £30 so I asked why and they said that phone 1 and 2 had been put on the same account on the vodaphone app. I think they rolled my contract on for phone 2 for some reason. But they should not be able to do that without your consent or written/email confirmation.I spoke to a lady and she told me that I would have to cancel and return phone 1. But that she would send me an upgrade phone (phone 3) in place of phone 1 which didn't make any sense to me all I could think of is maybe its to try get rid of my number and contract with phone 1 but why question their expertise? And on top of that she tried selling me broadband when I had just complained about being charged more than once. Surley she must have known I was struggling? She proceeded to then tell me it was out of her hands and I'd have to speak to the returns team. When I got through to them they told me it would be £600 as I am out of my cooling off period. Which is disgusting as did not know they had rolled my contract on phone 2 on. Bearing in mind I'm only pretty young, I can not afford this money, not upfront anyway.Anyway as I was upset I got someone else to speak on my behalf and the lady called Sharon told me that it was wrong of them to send me another phone out. She had to cancel it through dpd and told me if I got a parcel I was to refuse it.She mentioned briefly about changing my old number to a payg account or transferring my old number to my new phone. So I didn't get billed twice.Or selling my phone (1) which I don't really think it should come to.Update. Tuesday 1st June.The dpd parcel arrived with phone 3 which I refused. Sharon told me she would ring me back but still waiting on a call.Checked back on my phone 2 account and they are now trying to charge me £40.90 and gave me 100 gb without my consent and on on of that there are extra charges of £4 when I don't even use my old phone.On my Halifax account it says I have x2 estimated payments of £60 to go out this month which would total around £123. So I had to cancel my direct debit as I'm not taking any chances until this is sorted I can't afford to go over drawn, I only work part time. I don't even use phone 2 anymore, that was the whole point of me upgrading and the fact they are still charging me for it is disgusting when when said they should be switching it to a payg account or cancelling it (the ideal solution). Why should i keep paying for a phone I don't use? Please sort it out vodafone or you will be loosing a loyal customer and I will end up with a bad credit score. I might even be forced to take it further if we can not come to a solution.Hopefully it will get sorted but its really disgusting that they play with people's naivety, they make you feel so stupid too. Hoping I will be able to get a refund for all the money they have robbed me of.Update monday 7th June Checked the dpd website and my parcel that i refused back to vodafone has been delayed. Can not cancel my contract until phone 3 gets back to the vodafone warehouse. Hopefully it will get back within 30 days. Had my calls and texts cut off because I was forced to cancel my direct debit. Payed off my bill for phone 1, the new one which I should be paying anyway just not the old one phone 2 as i shouldn't be still paying for that as I said before but it has not made any difference and both of my phones have been cut off now. Due to me being messed about in the first place.Vodafone you make me sick.Thursday 10th June. Really happy with the customer service I received from javanna on Web chat after being passed from person to person.

One staff member told me they'd call me back within a few hours, which wasn't true.

I’d issues with connectivity, coverage in my house, the router, an address change which almost cost me hundreds and did cost me a new contract and extra months suffering what must be the worst home broadband going. I was elated when I was out of contract however there was more to come wasn’t there. After switching provider it has taken 5 attempts from the start of April until today for Vodafone to actually cancel the contract after trying to tell me I hadn’t provided 30 days notice. They were told in January. A number of telephone calls later and I’m told it’s resolved and I won’t be charged. I’m not convinced, the guy in complaints couldn’t have cared less. Maybe because it’s sunny outside. I’m not into these reviews, I like to think people should work it out for themselves but I had to join all the others on here saying the same thing....avoid Vodafone Home Broadband.If anyone from Vodafone is reading these reviews, I hope you’re taking note, your company needs to buck their ideas up.",JRB,2021,5,31,2,0.058,0.079,Positive

1734,Couldn't be happier,"Recently changed providers and ordered a new phone from Vodafone via a third party company and wanted to keep my old number. I'd used the PAC code supplied by my old provider but I had both handsets running on the same number with calls & texts going to the old phone.This was a bit frustrating as obviously I wanted to be able to use my shiny new phone.Phoned Customer Services on a Sunday and spoke to a very efficient and pleasant lady who checked what was happening, and assured me all was well. The porting of the new number had been instigated but wasn't complete yet and would be complete the following working day. She advised me there can be delays at the weekend. Next day I was up and running as advised.She also told me that my Vodafone fibre broadband package was out of date and that I was out of contract and that I could upgrade for a cheaper price. I said I would have a look at that as I was a bit dubious.I did a bit of research and this turned out to be correct, it appeared that I was eligible for the Superfast 2 fibre package offering nearly double the speed for about £6 less a month than I was paying for my current 35 mbps package which incidentally I had been very happy with.I phoned up Customer Services to enquire and spoke to a very friendly and efficient Customer Service Advisor (I wish I'd got her name because I would like to thank her) in Hull. She sorted out the whole process seamlessly, the new hub arrived the next day and I was up and running that evening. The connection has been stable, I've done daily speed tests using various speed test applications and these have ranged from 67 mbps to 70 mbps.I'm super impressed.Thank you Vodafone, top marks from me.",Chris P,2021,5,30,5,0.012,0.167,Positive

1738,absolutely insane!,"In janurary 2020 I lost my handset and subsequently had it blacklisted via Vodafone. I was advised that should I come back into possession of the lost handset it would be a simple request to have it unblacklisted and be able to use it again. In May 2020 upon moving to a new address I stumbled upon the lost handset while packing away all my belongings.-------------------------------------------------------Tuesday 25th May, 9:30am On the 25th of May at around 9:30am I called Vodafone customer service for the first time to request the blacklist to be removed. I was advised that because I had brought the phone from carphone warehouse it is them who must unblacklist the handset, but how can this be the case when I blacklisted the handset directly through Vodafone? So I was sent on a huge back and forth between Vodafone and carphone warehouse. Vodafone telling me i have to do it through carphone warehouse, and carphone warehouse telling me they don't and never have had the powers to blacklist or unblacklist phones so it has to be Vodafone who does it. I finally managed to get through to somebody at Vodafone with a bit of sense who really understood how frustrated I was by now, I can't remember his name but he agreed with me that it should just be a matter of a simple request and he then actioned this for me and requested that the blacklist be removed and advised me that I should wait up to 24 hours for this to take place and be able to use my handset once again.Tuesday 25th May, 17:30pm, online chat AkshitAfter all the hours of back and forth between Vodafone and carphone warehouse, I wanted to make sure 100% that it had been actioned like the previous advisor told me. so I used the online chat and spoke to Akshit who advised me that it had been definitely done and he had made a new request to make absolutely sure that the request had been made and he then advised me I should wait 24 - 72 hours for my device to be unblacklisted.-------------------------------------------------------26th May, 11:30am, online chat No name shown on chatHad waited nearly 24 hours and still the device was still blacklisted. I asked the advisor why this was and she advised me that the request had definitely been placed and I should wait 24 - 48 hours and it would then be completed, rest assured she said!-------------------------------------------------------Friday 28th May, 9am, 16mins Not sure of advisors nameTold me that unblacklist requests so far had been completed but hadn't been submitted, then advised me he had now submitted the request and would be unblacklisted within 24 hours-------------------------------------------------------Friday 28th May, 13:40pm, 20mins Chris (ILS team, Vodafone uk)Called to find out why my data speeds were so slow only to find out I have been being capped to 10mbps, on a 5g network might I add! since November 2019, asked for a plan migration to max speeds, was advised it would be done within 24 hours, so expecting it to be completed by 2pm on Saturday 29th May Also asked him if the request for unblacklisting had definitely been submitted by the previous advisor to which he advised me it had definitely been done as the submit button was greyed out on his screen meaning he can't click submit because somebody already has. So I should just wait until the advised time was up and call back if nothing changes.-------------------------------------------------------Saturday 29th May, 8.30am, 1hr 15mins Basmah Has told me that every request so far had been cancelled without reason and without informing me that my request had been cancelled. She said she has now referred this to the corporate security team and that this time it will 100% be unblacklisted within 24 hours by 9am Sunday Also advised me that plan migration would happen by 2pmHas offered £30 compensation off of my next bill because of capping me to 10mbps Has offered to look at compensation regarding the unblacklisting issues once the phone has been unblacklisted-------------------------------------------------------",a p,2021,5,29,1,0.026,0.059,Positive

1744,Monstrous and Deceitful Company with Rubbish Signal to boot,"In the many years that mobile phones have been around now I've had phone contracts with Three, Tesco, EE and most recently Vodafone. Spolier alert: Vodafone is hands-down the worst. For some context my partner and I live a stone’s throw from central London in Zone 2. We took out the same contract on the same day for Galaxy S21 Ultras (pre-launch). Vodafone lies about their coverage on their website. It says we should get good 4G indoor coverage at our address. We made sure to check before signing for 24 months. We get between 1 and 0 bars of signal and only when at the window. This is too weak to sustain a standard phonecall, let alone any kind of data driven service. Their customer care department is so fragmented and incompetent that we have spent so many hours on the phone to them and on hold that when taken together we must have lost a day of our lives each. We spent many days calling up, being put on hold, getting transferred, getting cut off, repeatedly having to explain the same thing over and over and ask them to ring back on my Tesco number - which I fortunately still had available for one more month. In the end I decided, that despite knowing that I would have to give up my lovely new phone the best decision would be to terminate the contract. Their vehement attitude was that that despite all this deliberation, I was outside of my cooling off period (by 1 day) and that I was therefore liable to continue to pay for another 24 months for a service that I could not use.Fuming at this outcome but also exhausted by this point I decided to take up the matter up once again a few days later. This time trying to negotiate for them to subsidise the my Tesco service, which was the only way to even get in touch with Vodafone after all. I just got shunted from one person to another, different departments, each person exhibiting a complete lack of understanding of the issue or compassion for our circumstances (stuck indoors during the hight of winter and a pandemic without a working phone).At one point someone in their technical department reassured me that our area would be upgraded to 5G within the next 2 weeks, which was completely at odds with what they had told my partner the week before in his battles with the same issue. They said to him that they had no intention of any infrastructure upgrades in our area for the foreseeable future. But here I was a week later being virtually guaranteed that we would have 5G within the next 2 weeks. I’m sure you can guess where this is going… No 5G, still 1 bar of signal.Vodafone offers wifi calling as on option, which is not enabled by default. Which at first seems perplexing, however after using it you can see why this is perhaps not all it's cracked out to be. There is no way to control it, so one can quite literally be sitting next to your wifi router and the call may drop because Vodafone’s network decided to stop routing your call through your trusty fibre line and instead try make use of the meagre one bar of signal which flitted momentarily passed your window, ending any conversation in the process. My only reliable way to communicate with people when I am at home is on wifi through Telegram or Zoom.Another outstandingly poor feature of Vodafone’s network is the diabolical international call quality. My nan in South Africa recently became very ill, she does not use Telegram so I called her up the “old fashioned” way. The audio quality was so bad that neither of us could make out what the other was saying. I had end off with ""can't hear you but glad you are feeling better"" I was then billed £17 by Vodafone for that luxury of that conversation. I’d have been better off writing a letter.Last night I was assaulted and my phone taken from me. As if the assault wasn’t bad enough, once more having to deal with Vodafone customer care was just as traumatic. I have finally relented and paid the £780-odd early termination fee to be free from this monstrous and decietful company.

I too, like a previous review, had a promise that internet speed will not dip below 10mb, and they monitor it constantly and will refund me automatically if it does.   But I started to have problems in March 2021 when internet connection would dip and stall my internet browsing or kick me out of watching internet tv.  The situation got to the point I contacted Vodafone at the beginning of April to report the issue.  Three engineers later, several/nearly 20ish calls, and feels like a whole year of my life wasted being put on hold on the phone (up to 15mins several times, to just being sent round in circles.  The issue of the internet go to the point were it dipped so low it could not connect / provide internet.  Vodafone, albeit polite customer service, follow a routine and have frustrated me to the point of anger.  They have been told by the engineers its not the line and it appears to be the router.  And Vodafone keep closing the case and saying it is solved. when it has not been.  Forcing me to phone up and complain again but they in turn insist they do another 24hour test when they have already been given evidence, and confirmed to me the line dipped and internet connect stopped several times when I was on the phone.

Landline constantly going down and always being on the phone to them about it. The customer service and technical teamdon’t seem to know what to do as they keep passing the faults between themselves. Just found out they never even ported the number from the previous provider (some how it worked though).so know I have them hounding me about payment. They cancelled my service without me telling them just because a new provider was trying to take over and now I have no working service and the new provider has no line to take over.  Left me with no working landline after we have just reopened 😡,Rass,2021,5,26,1,0.121,0.01,Negative
1766,I'd give these 0 * if I could,"I'd give these 0 * if I could. Ive Been a LOYAL customer to Vodafone for well over 15 years . Ive frankly had enough !!   I have had nothing but trouble since I swapped my broadband to these people . First of all I waited over 2 months for it to go live . The whole household ran off my mobile Internet.  Finally when it was switched on . The speed wasn't upto scratch . Its slow and sometimes if I'm upstairs I cant connect at all .  Its been a nightmare with 2 children in the house.  They sent me a txt msg saying they would never be able to supply my property with the agreed speed for the remainder of my contract ( 24 months) an they would discount my bill to accommodate this. This to me is a breech of our contract . Never the less I have to move out my property due to a family matter ,  so I called up today to cancel my contract as I'm moving. The new property already has vodafone broadband . I explained the breech and the fact it already has their broadband.  But I'm still being stung with 122 worth of fees . Even tho the property is supplied by vodafone already and the clear breech cancels out the contract anyway . Customer service chat  is nothing but a joke . Broken English and everything is  repeated and relayed like a robot . So frustrating . I woukdnt recommend vodafone to anybody . Get a great sim only deal for a fraction of the price",Janette,2021,5,26,1,0.044,0.127,Positive
1767,Mohammed- Complaints,"Mohammed in the complaints department was fantastic. After 6 months of repeatedly being sent debt collection letters for a service that was completely mis-sold by Carphone Warehouse, I finally have resolution. I took out a 30 day broadband device that I was told would finish after 1 month but I continued to receive letters to say I owed over £100 for a device I only used for 3 days! I was never told that there was a ‘rolling contract’ I had proof of everything, purchase info, email trails and bank statements to prove otherwise and Mohammed finally sorted everything. He was patient, understanding and managed to completely clear the account for me. After months of harassing letters, and advisers who had no idea what was going on, he was able to answer every question and resolve an ongoing issue. He is a credit to vodafone and deserves to have recognition for the fantastic job he did.",katie jane thomas,2021,5,26,5,0.07,0.113,Positive

Vodafone customer care is non-existent and their customer service is a joke.Have been charged over £65 this month for 56 ​landline calls that I didn't make. We never use the landline for calls and have seven consecutive months worth of previous bills showing zero calls made. Clearly either a mistake at Vodafone billing or a crossed line. Have now spent hours waiting in Vodafone's online chat, being passed from chatbots to humans (who sound an awful lot like chatbots), and well over an hour calling their customer complaints number listening to the same four songs play over and over while they put me on hold and I wait for my call to be escalated.Two weeks later I've got three different complaint reference numbers to my name, have been promised to be called within 48 hours four times, and have yet to be contacted by anyone. Oh, and after I asked them to block any further outgoing calls to avoid being wrongly charged even more, they managed to screw even that up and have blocked incoming calls as well.An absolute disgrace.",Steve,2021,5,25,1,0.124,0.114,Negative

They are unable to escalate to anyone when I call, including the complaints team. Apparently, I must wait 3-5 working days for the complaints team to call me back.

Now I have to pay for the June also just because they are irresponsible sending emails and letting people know that they are being overcharged. Please avoid it as this is a rip off and is disgraceful by doing this to people. They do have time to call and try to get you another deal (cheaper) just to stay with them but they haven't got time to email customers to let them know how horrible they are by overcharging them without their concern!

1777,Dreadful customer service,Dreadful customer service. I wish I'd never took out a contract. Promise the world and delivery is underwhelming. We bought a mobile broadband contract. The internet was so slow and poor in other parts of the house. You couldn't download Netflix and watch YouTube on another device let alone 10 devices as the service claims to promise under superfast broadband. I cancelled the contract in the 14 days cooling off period and now I can't get a refund on the device I returned and purchased as part of the contract.  I've made several chat calls and been promised the refund is being processed. That was a month ago. And I'm writing this review whilst holding on to their complaint department for over 45 mins. I've been cut off 3 times. Then complaints online chat went down during my conversation. Internet issues .. So you have to go through the whole issue again and security. So ive done this in total 6 times today via various methods of contact and it's now a hour and a half later trying to sort this refund out. I believe the billing need to be more up-to-date. Showing any credits and debits. As apparently my refund was there in the system but would not show up until the next months bill. Which would take this total time to cancel and get a refund over 2 months. I've never known service like this and it's gone down the pan since I was a vodafone customer some years ago. So customer relations agreed to processing the refund againist a bill and now the issue is closed.,Sharon,2021,5,25,1,0.065,0.05,Negative

This time around, I was given a £15 trade off discount from my plan because I traded in my old phone which is the reason I got the plan in the first place. A few months later they decide to remove this discount because apparently I didn't use the correct trade in option...none the less vodafone received the old phone, I have a reference number from my trade in with them and emails saying they have received the phone. Yet when I called them asking why the discount has been removed, they say all the proof is irrelevant because it wasn't the correct trade in. I said with the current pandemic I can't afford the plan without the discount and the man just told me to try and budget it in....the worst company and I would never recommend this trash to anyone else. If only I could cancel my plan and go with another company who doesn't change their minds after something has been agreed upon.

1790,Poor customer service.,"Added a second handset to my account, ordered a charger for it too. The charger came but for some reason the handset was sent to my old address. As we'd used a PAC code to bring the number from another contract, my partners phone was cut off early morning and as it was a Friday was left over the weekend with no phone while they rearranged delivery. When I called to rearrange delivery I got an automated system that told me to speak to an online advisor and hung up. I did, they ignored everything I said and told me to call the 191 number. So I did and only through persevering and telling the machine I wanted to talk to someone, did I get through to an agent. Unfortunately, they did not seem to understand why I had an issue with what had gone on and said if I wanted to complain to call back Monday once the 2nd phone arrived. I've been a customer nearly 7 years, so I chose to get in touch to complain about the service. They offered my £10 to make up for my lost time. £10. I laughed at this and said I was unhappy, suddenly they could offer £20, I found this more insulting, why not offer this first? I said so. magically, my lost time and poor experience was worth £30 - wow, why on earth is this a haggling situation, I'm just making a complaint, I'm not in a flea market. Over 7 year vodafone have been fine with me and the network etc is all great. But, if you every need to talk to someone, and have to deal with customer service, prepare for a terrible experience, genuinely the worst customer service department on the planet.

After numerous calls, I have been told as I am on a self-monitoring contract ( what is this and when was it clearly explained) that they will not refund the difference as I did not state, even though I said I would not be upgrading, changing to a sim only deal. It is not their responsibility…… Why would I know this after the length of time I have been with this provider??

I have never missed a payment bill ever . On 11 September 2020 we moved to  ,St Albans  and straight away we noticed that within the house area the signal was so bad ( 1 line ) that we couldn't receive or make calls sometime ,then same issue at work in centre of LONDON ,  also was in the middle of this pandemic and sometime i worked from home and i couldn't do my job answering emails and calls because no signal . I always thought the issue is the phone I reported that to Vodafone several times and the answer was always the same "" works are undertaken within the area and in 7 days signal should come back to normal"" weeks past the issue was there and the answer to my complaints were the same , most of the conversations with Vodafone were by them calling me , at some point one of their people was begging me to close the complaint , just a few emails i record of and i will upload as evidence but mostly everything was verbal phone conversations . After a very long period of time and having me going through this issues for so long Vodafone offered me £60 refund and free special discounted upgrade for two new phones and i said ""yes"" . They probably used my ""yes"" and closed the complaint straight away . Next , i went on their app to start looking to upgrade to discover that the special discounted upgrade option they offered wasn't special at all , i meant it was an offer that anybody , any new customer that wanted to join Vodafone could get , its what was available   on their website . I went back to Vodafone and i said that complaint is not closed yet as they lied to me offering a special discounted upgrade which wasn't , they ignored my calls and everything . I also contacted CISAS and the fact that i said ""yes"" and the complaint was closed under Rule 2.2.13 they had to uphold the objection for three times. 9 months since the issue and my complaint ,  i still had 3 contracts and no signal on one of them.

1845,Worse customer service EVER,"If I could give it nothing I would. Shocking customer service, we signed up the broadband the first person I spoke to did not do it correctly and booked us in for installation on a day we did not want. We managed to spend total of five hours trying to resolve this issue on the phone to them, eventually we just had to have the date she put in and take time off work. It was either that or they would have to rebook the entire thing. The installation took place on the Friday and when the man arrived to install it he asked where the router was, I said it’s not arrived, he said it should arrive in the next day or two. After several phone calls to Vodafone and dealing with people who had very little training (putting us on hold for very long periods of time we are talking up to 40 mins at times while they went off and tried to resolve the issues and never did) they kept telling us the router had been delivered already. We were assuring them it has not been delivered and we could not use the service until it was. Again we spent several hours either on hold or being transferred waiting waiting to find out what we could do. Nobody knew what to do and eventually over three phone calls to Vodafone customer service people told us it was being sent out. Of course this was a lie we did not receive it, A whole week after the installation we still have not received our Router. By this point I was speaking and phoning them every day long periods of time, being placed on hold while they went off doing Who knows what. We were about to be cut off by our other provider and I work from home and was really concerned I would end up with no Wi-Fi. I then spoke to someone on one of the days and he told me the order had to be completed before they could send me the router, he said this will take 24 to 48 hours for the order to be completed and then he would order the router which would take five days after that. This would have been two weeks after our installation. By this point we were so frustrated and angry we didn’t want the service with them anymore it had been non-stop nightmares since day one, I contacted our other provider and told them I wanted to stay with them. Called Vodafone yet again to cancel it. He told me he could cancel it but I needed to phone the next day to make sure we weren’t billed. I called the next day and the lady said she couldn’t do it because I was only a level one on the account and they needed to speak to my husband who is the main account holder. I told her I’ve been speaking to people for the last four days she said oh well you shouldn’t have been because only account holder can do these sort of things on the account. She literally told me I had to get my husband to call back in a couple of days to make sure I’m not getting billed for service I’ve never used. If I asked to speak to a manager I get told they can ring you within 48 hours. Nobody at any point was completely horrified about our service, Absolutely none of the people I spoke to wanted to resolve the issue. A few of them told me they would call me and didn’t phone. One of the calls they said the system was down and the guy I spoke to told me I should ring back in 24 hours. If I calculated how long I’d actually spent on the phone (I may look at my phone bill) it probably is around 10 to 12 hours time being on hold and speaking to them. I would never ever use their service, I would never recommend them to anyone I know and I want other people to realise what an awful company this is. I’m still waiting for it to cancel and disconnect and my husband still has to call back to make sure we don’t get charged for it. No point has a manager got involved and contacted me to apologise for this awful service, if I was head of Vodafone I would be absolutely appalled by my team.

The question was asked about what would happen to the account once we left and they explained that as we were out of contract and now on a rolling contract and up to date on payments that the account would be suspened. Only to find out in March that since January 2021 I was having negative markers on my account. This has dropped my credit score so much and with hoping to get a mortgage, it has really affected the chances at the moment. For 6 weeks I have been on the phone to them and fobbed off by Chris, Trish from converged care , Nayer, Lewis and the other people i have spoken too. Admitting that they will refund the account that apparently has now accumulated a £152 balance. How ? Your guess is as good as mine?! They apparently didnt have my cancellation call on record (convinient) But apparently they were taking this charge off me and putting the account back to £0, but the account was broken and couldnt there add the credit and would take 3-5 working days...6 times this happened. So 6 weeks , I was calling an hour a time! I called again today to check up on the still broken account to be told i havent  called them since march! My last call was exactly 4th May at 19.28 but shock...they dont have it on record. I was again escaled to a senior manager, to be told that i owen £148 but as a good gesture they would waver the £40 in order to get my negative credit amended and therefore needed to pay £108. I have paid the £108 in absolute desperation to not have this on my credit file, funny how the account has been accredited £108 by myself but for 6 weeks the account was apparently broken so they couldn't credit it and still dont know what ive actually paid for. Long story short. Keep a record of when you call them, ask for their names (although even when I quoted Nayer which is a very unusual name she told me I have never spoke to her!). Always ask for an email of confirmation because they are absolure liars some of them. Im disgusted and have never experienced such poor customer service.

1873,"Unlawful payment taken, terrible service.","Last year my partner and I were keen to purchase Vodafone's excellent wifi package - high speeds for low price. We purchased and waited for out router, which never arrived. On 5-6 separate occasions I sat on hold to Vodafone for over 20m only to be told 'wait 3-5 days for delivery'. This continued for weeks. My partner and I were unable to work safely from home as a result og Vodafone's incompetence in the matter and their reluctance to actually resolve the case by sending us a new router. Finally I lost my patience and called again to cancel the account and remove my details - a painstaking process. Eventually I managed to get them to cancel the account back in December. The account supposedly did not cancel, and had to be cancelled a second time in January. Despite this, I was recently billed for a broadband service that was never even set up. I immediately cancelled the direct debit that Vodafone had set up despite me asking for cancellation, then received an email demand for more money for an overdue bill! I have been on the phone to Vodafone today for 20 minutes already, only to be told that I can only get my refund for the payment they took by calling my bank, and that the cancellations have not yet gone through.Customer service representatives are very polite, and I feel for them as they likely deal with several complaints. But they seemingly have zero power to fix any issues like this, so what is the point of getting customers to call them? I honestly expect I will continue to receive demands from Vodafone for further payments despite my third attempt today at cancellation. I will NEVER use Vodafone Broadband, no matter how good their deals seem, in the future. Steer clear.UPDATE - 22/09/21We have received a letter from Vodafone stating that they believe we owe them money, and they are passing on out case to Zinc Group Credit Management i.e. debt collectors. I am absolutely horrified - after all we have been through with unlawful payments taken from our account, Vodafone are now trying to get us to send them MORE money.

I then phoned two weeks later to check, was told the termination did not go through, however, this operator will put it through this time, just to wait a week then it should be done. Since then and up until September 2020, I have called every two weeks, each time to be told this will be sorted, escalated, however, nothing was done, each time being told some error occurred, but not to worry it will be sorted. In September, I had a look at my credit file, and noted Vodafone added a mark saying I have £200.00 that are outstanding and need to be paid. I phoned Vodafone and asked why this is, explained the situation, and the operator reassured me that the account will be closed that evening, and the balanced wiped out. I waited about a week, then phoned again to check, and was advised that this is in the process of being sorted. Ever since then, I have called, and each time being fobbed around, passed between departments, and then the last operator to have me for that day would tell me this is getting escalated, not to worry, and that any outstanding balance would be cleared. On my credit file, September 2020, until 2021: January,February, and March, are shown as missed payments. After calling numerous times, I eventually phoned Vodafone again in February, and this time I spoke with a operator that initiated the termination of the account. I asked him what about the credit reports, and he transferred me to the customer care team. I spoken with them and was advised that I only needed to pay approx. £190.00, this being the early termination fee. I was told to pay this after the account is terminated, on 18/03/2021.  When I asked about the credit score, they said it can all becorrected by the credit score team, and that I shouldn't have been billed for any month after June 2020. I called after the account was terminated, as I saw that on my credit score the balance due was now displaying £335.00. I thought this amount was in error, and I explained this to the operator who re-affirmed that I was right, and that from £335.00 only £190.00 needed to be paid for the early termination fee, and that the difference are bills that have been generated after June but shouldn't have. I was advised this will be escalated, and I should be getting a call later that day. That call never happened, and nothing happened. I left this for some time, thenonce again, called on 6/5/2021. This time, I was transferred from department to department, the call lasted 2 hours. This time, having had enough being fobbed around, I agreed to pay the £335.00 just to get this done with, however, I asked about the credit score. I was told by the operator she'd discuss this after I pay. I was sent a link through text messages, it had no details on it, just the space where I need to enter bank details. After I put them in, I noticed £390.00 had been taken from my bank account, this was never said to me, nor did I agree to pay this.  Then, the operator spoke to the credit score team, who said all these missed payments will be shown as late. I challenged this, saying it's Vodafone's mistake for misinforming me, but the credit score team was having none of it. I was transferred to another operator, who after being told all this, said I'll be getting a call later thisevening. Knowing this will not happen, I phoned Vodafone 2 hours later, and spoke directly to the credit score team, and was advised the payments will still be shown as missed. I explained that I have been misinformed, however, I was told nothing could be done.CONCLUSION: Avoid having to do anything with them, they seem more like those fake HMRC scammers calling about a tax refund, rather than an actual company.  I have no idea how such company can operate to such a standard in the UK.  The way they treat their customers is just appalling, rather than focusing on keeping you in the long-term, they just focus on the £30-£100 pounds.

1908,Vodafone credit file abuse can impact your ability to get a mortgage renewal - be very careful,"6 months ago I purchased a mobile phone from carphone warehouse. I received the phone and returned the phone within the maximum alloted time; as it was not of the quality that I am accustomed to.3-4 months later I received a debt collection letter saying that I owed vodafone 60 pound and was in breach of contract.I contacted the debt collection agency and said I had no contract with the firm and what on earth was this about. They confirmed that they believed I had not returned the phone and was in breach of contract.I contacted vodafone and they said that they had received the phone but that my contract has an outstanding balance of 30 pounds. I explained that I had not activated the phone and returned the phone and not accepted the contract. They had said that I had not cancelled in time even though the phone was returned in time and as I had cancelled my direct debit they reported me to a debt collection agency to retrieve the money.I asked them to cancel the contract before I reported them to the ombudsman. They said they would only do so if I paid a certain amount of money. I refused and then instead suggested I pay a lesser amount of 20 pound which I paid to make them go away. I made it clear that this would be the last money they would ever get off me and that they should never contact me ever again. I was assured by the manager that this would not impact my credit rating and I hung up and got back to my life.Recently I was remortgaging my property and found that I couldn't get the mortgage provider I wanted.At that time I was also in a rush to find a new mortgage as I was rolling over into the default payment period which was significantly higher than normal mortgage rate.I had spent a number of nights attempting to find a mortgage provider but was not being accepted by anybody. I finally gave up and went back to my original mortgage provider and accepted the terms that they provided.Recently I was messing about with a decision in principle tool for a personal loan as I happen to work in the business. These tools don't impact your credit rating and I thought I'd just use my own details for test purposes. I was refused for a very small loan and I was baffled as to how this was possible.My interest was peaked and I signed up to up to a credit file checking service to understand why my rating was so poor.The credit check came back with a low score which was linked to a single defaulted account of 30 pound.Vodafone had added a defaulted account to my credit report and not removed it even after I paid off the account which I had never even signed up to.This impacted my ability to remortgage my property and also to get a credit card.Vodafone never contacted me once prior to targeting me in this vicious manner.Vodafone - I will never buy another service or product off you ever again and will never recommend you to another friend, neighbour or colleague again. I can assure you that this bad will is going to cost you more than the £20 you squeezed out of me.Thanks for the worst customer experience of my life.I will use this experience as an example of how not operate in business when talking to friends/neighbours and colleagues and ensure that behaviour like this is stamped out.And if your think this is an isolated instance and not behaviour driven from aggressive money making senior management tactics - think again. Check out articles about Vodafone in 'This Is Money', 'The Sun' and 'Which', to mention just a few. They have also been amongst the most heavily fined of all the Telcos this year with consistent serious breaches of customer trust.Do your self a favour and avoid this company until they get their act together.Note: this review was recently flagged and removed as it appeared to violate some rules on trust pilot site. So I've updated with additional detail on what actually happened and reposted. I've not been given an explanation as to why this is by TrustPilot which suggests something may be not right with TrustPilots policies and procedures.

1912,Only taken seriously if your a man,"For the last six months myself and my partner have had little to no internet signal on our phones for most of the day (does increase later in the evenings so can’t be the property itself) which has been extremely difficult since working from home, we had to go out for walks just to receive our emails before getting WiFi and we had gotten unlimited internet packages so we didn’t need to do this. So my partner called up vodaphone and managed to get out of his contract early with £1500 left to pay for FREE! As if the signal becomes weak, poor or sporadic in your area, then you have rights to cancel under the supply of goods and services act 1982. So I thought I could do the same we have the same contract only I have only 3 months (£150) left to pay, but I was laughed at by the phone operator and not taken seriously at all. I gave all of the same information to them as my partner only I was far more polite and therefore not allowed out early.

1913,I have been a loyal customer with…,"I have been a loyal customer with Vodafone for years. The last few weeks have been extremely disheartening. I have two mobile phone contracts with vodafone. One phone got damaged, so i need to pay another 6 months of my bills for a broken phone. I got another phone which was 39 pound. Not even 1 month later, the price increased to almost 42 pound per month. The price of the broken phone also increased. I then decided to stay with vodafone when having broadband installed. What a huge mistake. They lied to me when they sent out the wifi hud and engineer. They said i could have fibre broadband. So i took it. The wifi hud arrived. Two days later the engineer called out. He looked downstairs and said he can't get my wifi live as the full apartment building i live in has no fibre. He told me it would take 2 to 3 weeks to have the correct wiring installed. Vodafone have increased two of my bills, lied about fibre being available, just to use me as an excuse to have their cables installed to my apartment block, and have left me with no wifi for weeks now. If all this isn't enough, i told them i am not taking the broadband anymore and i will opt for unlimited max data on my phone. I was getting over 100 mb download speed. After i upgraded to unlimited max data, my speeds never go above 6 mb download speed. They have raised the price of a 3 week old contract, lied to me about broadband availability, left me without wifi for weeks and as a final blow they throttled my 5g data from over 100 to 6 or less download speeds after i upgraded; so i don't need their broadband installed! They also ruined my credit score leaving me unable to go to talktalk. I could go on all day about this company, they are scum. However, i need to go and spend all day on the phone to them to finalise my cancellation. I requested 3 times that i cancel fibre installation and they give me a number to phone after hours on chat.

I could have done this myself free of charge, a very simple task but my stepdad didn't realise this and thought it was a very difficult task! I am so shocked that this is happening please beware of your elder family being taken advantage of in this way! I appreciate your reply Vodafone but again its day light robbery of the elderly and what you have listed can be easily done by me, certainly do not need a tech team to do that!

1930,I am so angry with vodafone,I am so angry with vodafone. My mother in law is 89. She has a mobile which we purchased for her several years ago. She rarely used it. It is mainly for emergencies so therefore she always topped up when needed. A few weeks ago she said her phone was broken so we purchased a new one for her. When we tried to swap SIM cards it wouldn't fit so we asked her for the paperwork to contact vodafone. We then found out that in February 2020 she went in to top her mobile up and was talked into taking out an 18 month contract costing £23 per month. What despicable human being talks an 88 year old lady into this. I have called vodafone customer help line. Was kept on the line for 30 mins(presumably on premium rate) then told that a manager would ring me back. Of course this has never happened. My husband went into the store to sort out the SIM (which also didn't work). He mentioned the contract problem and was met with a so what attitude. The store is Walsall. Luckily non of the rest of my family are with Vodafone and as soon as possible we will move my mother in law to another provider. However this has cost a pensioner hundreds of pounds.

Total cost in the region of £250. Whilst on the phone to them, I looked up the prices online and found that they went for in the region of £80 to £130 when bought outright. I know enough about tech to know that that was a TERRIBLE deal but couldn't help but feel sorry for most people, think older generation who are not as tech savy, who would fall for what essentially felt like a scam call.

Kavita who was dealing with the case has been rude down the phone to my mother as well accusing her of lying in a roundabout way. So set up a case now for CISAS to adjudicate and judge the situation and level of compensation. Dispicable company. I'll be going elsewhere for communication services and not recommending vodafone to anyone.In response to Vodafone the issue was resolved albeit not fully covering financial losses but fed up with being given the runaround. Refused to refund, just credited my account which will be cancelled withing the next few days. Found out afterwards that it was agreed that a refund of 5 months landline and internet charges (£25/mth) but was refunded £60.

1960,MY NEW VODAFONE IPHONE WAS STOLEN BY DPD,"I placed an order with Vodafone for a Apple iPhone SE 2020 256GB white. That was on the 26th March.I have not received my delivery and it's now gone missing but was actually stolen by DPD.Vodafone told me that my phone was delivered by DPD to 2-4 C...Road, on the 12th April. Without my knowledge and without my consent!! I was at home waiting for my new phone on that day. I do actually live at 66 C...Road, which is about 15 minutes away from no 2-4. DPD say they delivered my phone to flat 18 at 2-4 C....Road and to a person called S.... There are over 21 flats listed at this scam address and most or all of these flats do not exist. The houses in my street do normally all have only a maximum of 4 flats. DPD submitted as proof of delivery a Google maps foto. I did not receive a delivery notification or confirmation email from DPD. When I track my phone on DPD, it says, not delivered, estimated delivery 12th April. Today is the 27th April. I contacted Vodafone on the 13th or so April and was told by Ali that I would receive my phone or a replacement on the 26th April. He promised me to call me back within 3 days maximum. He never called back. I got no phone. I talked and chatted to many other Vodafone staff, among them Bhagyesh, Fahrad and Ahmed. I waited hours and hours while they told me they needed to check things.  I raised 3 or so complaints. Agents sent me messages that they would call me but then they did never call. After more than 1 month of waiting and already paying for my new phone which is lost or actually stolen, I am being told, like today, that they are investigating. I have been told that I cannot cancel my contract for my new phone which I never received. I was told I cannot get a replacement phone until the investigation is completed. Something is not right. The first agent, Ali, assured me that it would be absolutely guaranteed that I would get my phone on the 26th April. I am at the end of my wits. I suffer from stress and lost my appetite and got now insomnia. I have to deal with incompetent call and complaint handlers. Ali, the agent, told me that every other day, he gets at least 1 complaint of a new phone lost or stolen and that it happens all the time. Today, I have already been waiting for 4 hours on the phone. I cannot work normally anymore. This is torture. As a consumer, I am being literally abused. It is distressing that the agents have been lying to me. It is impossible to be connected to a Manager which I have requested again and again. There is no person higher up that they allow me to speak to. They do also refuse to give me the contact details for their Manager or their legal department. I have asked again and again to cancel this order because I never received the phone and because it is over a month now that I ordered it. I ordered it on the 26th March. All Vodafone agents, including the first one I spoke to, Ali, said that it is impossible for me to cancel the order. They say it is because I cannot return the phone, well, it was stolen. Also, that I would have to pay a penalty fee because I would be ending my contract early. I have waited 2 hours today on the phone just now with Farah, the  no X agent I talked to today , and also she will not let me cancel my order. The call ended after about 2 hours while she was probably doing other work and leaving me under the impression that she was trying to help me and had me waiting. So, I called her back, and I have now been waiting again for one hour while she is looking into 'things'.Under the Consumer Rights Act and the Consumer Contracts Regulations, the goods remain Vodafone's responsibility until they are received by me. I am shocked that the Vodafone customer relations team, who are the highest order as agent Alex told me today, do not even have a clue about consumer rights. When I read the consumer rights out to Farah, she could not even understand what I was saying. As a Vodafone customer, I have become the victim of a crime. This crime was committed by the DPD driver who stole my phone. I am shocked to see that neither Vodafone nor DPD are abiding by the laws of the UK, albeit operating in the UK. From day one it was clear, that my phone was stolen. A phone cannot be delivered to an address that does not exist. It is disgusting that DPD offer a Google maps picture as proof of the delivery of my phone, and the picture is even of a park! which is not on my street.  This organized mobile phone theft crime should be stopped. Vodafone should also train their staff in consumer rights and the laws of this country. I am now on a two year contract with Vodafone for a phone that has never been delivered to me and have already paid the first bill for a phone that I do not have. And the next bill is soon due. The situation is appaling for a consumer  DPD equals disaster. DO NOT USE DPD! And do not deliver mobiles without the signature of the customer. DPD equals delivery problems.",Reni Leu,2021,4,27,1,0.141,0.037,Negative

Call after call and no resolve, there's no unity between various offices and I have around 6 hours worth of recorded calls ready for the termination fee I should not get because I've been forced to have a phone I wanted returning.I waited 6 weeks for an unlock code that never worked but caused phone to go into freeze mode. After telling them I was annoyed and ended up paying a shop to unlock they then sent code following day... Same code that locked me out.One staff member was off with me even though obvious the problems their end so I told her to get someone else as I could see she wasn't on my side and instead of apologising transfered me to a lady I couldn't even understand (foreign) so I had to hang up. Another one left me on the phone over an hour with music playing and I had to hang up.I won't tarnish all vodaphone workers but the many that don't help with resolution spoil it. I'm hardly suprised the reviews are bad here.... Wish I'd of checked before switching.Had absolutely no issues til I needed to speak with them.

1969,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service. Contacted them to try and change the delivery address of an order, was told that it wouldn't be a problem and that they had changed it. I checked a couple days before the order was to be sent, and the address had not been changed. I talked to customer service again, and they again told me that it had been sorted. The delivery still went to the wrong address. All customer service takes forever to sort out, and you are constantly bounced around between service reps who require you to go through the same process again and again. I have nothing good to say about them.",ACS,2021,4,26,1,0.079,0.02,Negative

1971,Bad network and even worst customer service,"Bad network, and even worst customer service. I have chosen Vodafone for the business network, unfortunately, a huge mistake. Firstly, I have zero working network (living in the third zone in London!) in the flat not a bunker. So lack of service is absolutely not acceptable. I have requested customer service to call me as could not find easily a phone number of their website. And the SALES TEAM calls me?! Finally, when signed up I signed the DD form, but every month I have to make manual payments, sadly the app does not work most of the time, so its just a headache. I am just really deeply disappointed. Vodafone CEO should do better or resign having such a disorganized ship.",Agnieszka Gradzewicz-Akal,2021,4,26,1,0.201,0.063,Negative

1973,Appalling service (mobile internet,"Appalling service (mobile internet: data sim - sim router internet), signal, reliability and customer care. 3 months of almost constant calls to Vodafone and having to constantly monitor signal, latency (600's, 900's and infinite on occasion) and internet speeds. I've had no responses to requests for clarification and confirmation that I can leave this useless service without penalty. I've been constantly deceived with regard to mast repairs and improvements. I'm in the middle of London, though clearly in a VF bad spot less than 5 minutes from Brixton tube! I've had failed Zoom calls, lost access to email and online work servers - all in the middle of this most difficult period when internet access is an essential. The saga continues - In fact none of my requests have been acknowledged officially, apparently all of the people, mostly in Egypt that you speak to, don't have the power to do anything at all. I've been moved from one virtual perspex screen to another, whilst the ever moving deadlines for mast repair works continue for ever presumably. I've been fed a new line and new dates every time I've called. Though it regularly goes full circle where Vodafone insist on going through the same test my equipment cycle as they try to blame me for the poor service. I want out, I don't want to give another minute of my life to Vodafone. I pay them an exorbitant fee for a sub-standard service. I want compensation and to leave tomorrow for a provider that can do the job. Customer service and the phone lines beggar belief in terms of smoke screens designed to disempower, fluster and prevent customers from getting through. Talk to Toby online they cry, a bot with no mind who'll eat up more of your life before eventually pointing out that he's a bot and can't actually do anything, sending you back to the vicious circle of Vodafone's no contact machinery. I've pointed out that being constantly told things that turn out to be untrue, sets up a climate of near total distrust. Vodafone - I want out, completely and utterly! I won't pay for the privelege of leaving a company who quite frankly ought to be drummed out of the business.",ghollo,2021,4,25,1,0.12,0.044,Negative

Seriously avoid. Vodafone to put it politely has gone extremely down hill. A V O I DEdit= funny how Vodafone reply on here and not other places. Just cancelled my contract. Worst company ever.

Iphone XR , 64GB, 10mb network speed £50 monthly- 24 months contract.Be all right if network works properly. Its too expensive when network doesn’t work or its slower ( can’t open basic website, WAZE sat nav not working etc.) and customer have to struggling with customer service. I not recommend this company. AVOID VODAFONE . I want cancel contract but they want charge me £650 - after almost 10 years with Vodafone. I don’t will be paid for cancellation- they should cancel for free because they stolen my time and money.I know how to check speed, the network not working in London random areas.",Daniel M.,2021,4,24,1,0.147,0.084,Negative

Dealing with a bunch of incompetent people and no manager gives a heck to call you and help you out.It's been A WHOLE MONTH since I have no signal on my phone, no bars on my internet Mifi at home, no connection whatsoever. Been told there's maintenance in the area ( that was a month ago ) - ever since I kept calling.... I am now told everything is fixed but I still don't have signal. This is BS!They even sent me a new sim! NEW SIM!!!!!!! NEW CONTRACT!!!!!! For them to make my bill x2 higher for something I didn't use and to take the whole entertainment pack away, which I can't re-activate.Got in touch about it and I've been told it'll take 3-5 business days to look into.Do you know what this means? Another month!!!!Called billing dept... I am paying bills for something I can't use.. What do they say??? 'We can compensate you after we make it work'. F me! This is crazy. When are you going to make it work?Why is everyone so incompetent?They're lucky you can't walk on them and smash your phone on their desk.
