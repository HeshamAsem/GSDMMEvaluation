0,What a Scam,"I called virginmedia to cancel my account on January 3. The person I was speaking to suggesting downgrading my package first so that I pay a lower monthly fee for January and will still be able to cancel the new contract within the first two weeks. I tried to call back on the 15th and couldn’t get through, even with this WhatsApp service. On the 16th I tried the WhatsApp service again and no one got in touch so I called. The agent this time told me I’d have to pay &gt;£200 to cancel my account even though I was within the two week grace period. He said he didn’t know why the first agent didn’t tell me this and only suggested he could put me through to customer service to make a complaint. I accepted that offer and when I got to customer service they told me I was through to O2 and couldn’t do anything about my virgin media account! Is this a scam?!? I would try calling again but can’t face the waiting queues. I’ll also email the customer service team with this message …my guess is that they’ll tell me I’m not past the 14 day grace period….let’s see…",Zina Smith,2022,1,16,1,0.079,0.036,Negative

2,"Price going up, speed way down. Awful.","Price for my broadband keeps going up. Now £57/month for 300 mbps. Guess what? Now over a week running at under 3 mbps. When you run the service status it says everything is fine; then you dig deeper and it says there is a problem with the service. All it says is “we’re on it and it will be resolved soon”. Well, over a week is not soon. Try finding a simply way to send a message to customer service? No chance. I guess if my product was so poor I might try to avoid customers too. Actually, no I wouldn’t - I would solve the problem.This company will never do proactive communication will they?",JPD,2022,1,16,1,0.136,0.079,Negative

4,Virgin media sucks,First year after I got the 220mb download and 20mb upload broadband I was in a 18 month contract the WiFi was fine I always randomly turned off during the day as soon as they contract ended they increased the price almost doubling the cost of the bill and now the WiFi turns off around 4-5 times a day the download and upload speeds are almost unusable.,MRmilksquash,2022,1,16,1,0,0.061,Positive
5,Just awful customer service,"Honestly there are no words to describe how awful their customer service is. On hold for over an hour, then I get disconnected. Call back, get put on hold again, rinse and repeat.Web chat not much better either, I just want to cancel my service because I'm moving away and it's taken me 45 minutes so far. Biggest waste of time. Also very very expensive for such a basic service.",Jasmine May,2022,1,16,1,0.165,0.056,Negative
6,Utterly dishonest,"Shockingly bad experience at end of current 18 month contract. VM staff altered my contract without my agreement . They raised the monthly payment without my agreement. They removed important  financial information on my contract without agreement. They brought forward the monthly payment date without my agreement. They sent me three new contracts over two days, none of which had the agreed correct monthly payment. They refused to answer questions regarding their decision to manually draw the monthly payment from my bank rather than normal direct debit system. They kept me waiting on the phone for up to three hours a time, over three days, to respond to phone queries. They cut off the line two times,after making me wait up to three hours.  What we agreed (I spoke with 4 different agents, retention team, and customers services) was completely ignored.  They’ve taken over 8 hours, and still counting, of my life trying to get away with all of this.  Am I right in thinking these actions by VM are unlawful?",Graham Lord,2022,1,16,1,0.124,0.033,Negative

8,Ridiculous early disconnection fee…,"Ridiculous early disconnection fee after nearly 2 years of use. As a customer who is paying on a monthly basis it seems extremely onerous to be charge for leaving especially as it is extremely unlikely that everyone will be able to choose to wait to move house at an exact point of the year. This is an appalling clause in the agreement and as such I will not be reconnecting with virgin media at my new property. I would also discourage friends and family from using the service for this reason.  Reward loyal customer service,  don't slam them with an overblown charge for leaving as they may wish to reconnect at a later date.",Tia Gatti,2022,1,16,1,0.063,0.144,Positive

The latest excuse is that wifi and broadband speed can be affected by fish tanks and moisture - we haven't even got a fish tank.  refusal to acknowledge an issue when 2 people within 100 yards of me on a lower internet package are getting 5 times the speed. absolute morons,martin bainbridge,2022,1,16,1,0.108,0.052,Negative

If you do finally get through , they either repeat everything you say as it’s new information they are giving you.  They 9/10 times disconnect you during a transfer. Really do not ring back when they say. They list is endless. What a shame . Poor poor service and really no care.

14,Dishonest and poor customer service,"Contract ended and was told my package was no longer available, but we finally agreed on a higher speed package for a price of less than £30/month. Great. But since then my bills have been £51 and when I finally called to ask what was going on, was told my contract was for £51 and there was “nothing in the notes” about us having agreed a cheaper rate. Really dodgy practice there and on top of that, the customer service rep sounded half asleep and uninterested. I’ve been a Virgin customer for more than six years but I will be breaking this contract and getting away from them. It will be worth the penalty.",KG,2022,1,16,1,0.068,0.122,Positive

16,About as useful as a chocolate teapot!,You wait for 30+ mins to get through. To be told your in the wrong department. You give your password about 6 times. Then get it wrong cos you can't understand what character they want from you. Attitude to complaints are horrific. They don't even seem to care they are dropping customers like flies either.  Cancelled my account over a month ago.  Yet they claim they have zero record of me cancelling my services. Two days now wasted an hour and half to get nowhere.  Totally done with calling. They can send it to a debt collector when they finally stop the service.  Might actually get somewhere with them.  Got no Intention of ever returning to this awful company. Sad thing is.  They never used to be this way.  12 years I was a customer. Gone to sky now. Way better customer service and issues get sorted. I doubt this company will still be operating much longer.

26,Disgraceful standard of service,"Disgraceful standard of service. I needed engineer to deal with lack of dialling tone on landline. The first challenge is in trying to contact VM. They send you round and round a loop on their website. I then discovered the number to ring and duly made an appointment with the robot for an engineer to come between 12 and 4 pm. No-one showed up! It hadn't stopped the text messages telling us that we'd be charged £25 if nobody over 18 was at home, or asking us if anyone in our home has symptoms of Covid! They should be refunding me £25 for their ""no show"" behaviour. They don't deserve to remain in business. As others here have found, VM are keen when you're a new customer but after a while, you're charged more and more for less and less. It's an offence against decent standards in business.

29,Virgin Media are rippers,"Virgin Media are rippers. First of all they kind of forcing me to take the 18 months contract as they want to keep stuck people as long as possible so be careful before you sign with them. I have been a loyal customer for 4 years and a half. Every year they raise their prices to upgrade their network which is wrong. After they make lots of profits, they want to upgrade their network from customers money which is unfair. When you want to cancel, they charge you hundreds of pounds when there should be a clear fixed exit fee on the contract. On your contract they send you to their website to see how much the exit fee is. They promise speeds that are not always the same. I was on 350 mbps and many times when I was checking the speed, I had 100 mbps. So, they charge a big price for something they don't constantly offer. During the weekend they slow down the speed because they know many people stay home and do streaming. Their prices are over all the other providers. I will not recommend them. Search other providers they might give you a bit less speed, but the prices are lower, and they won't change their prices during the contract. I hope that helps.",Galan Gheorghe,2022,1,15,1,0.052,0.088,Positive

Was advised that I could only give 30 days notice, this could not be scheduled and it was not possible for the agent to call me back next week to give notice then. Asked to speak to a supervisor. Was cold transferred and new advisor asked me to give all of my details to start from scratch. I asked if they had been briefed at all and the new advisor said that she would check the notes. She promptly hung up on me and did not call back. I am now unclear if or when my service will be disconnected and am not willing to spend any more time or money calling back again.",Mike Foulks,2022,1,15,1,0.014,0,Negative
32,Such an awful experience very bad…,"Such an awful experience very bad customer service all they care about making is money no value so whatever to their loyal customer who is been using their services almost 13 years. Being new customer online offer much better than virgin offer to old customers. As this is annoying every time contact ends they put prices dramatically. My neigouber pay £28 a month for broadband for up to 200mb whereas I’m exiting customer demanding me to pay £36 a month for 100mb as the is the best they can offer. Previously contract we agreed for £33 yet the first 3 months charged me £52 tried to talk to them many times as they apologised as this will not happen again yet they kept charging me £52 until the last spoke to someone where he advised me to cancel the direct debit and make a monthly payment which I was doing it for almost 1 year. However, now they want to increase it to £37, therefore, the funny thing is when I speak to their agent they seem to be ok when losing customers not trying to help at all. I explained I’m not interested in their extra services TV and phone all I need is broadband. It happened previously when I canceled 2 of my SIM cards contract. It seems an end for me to use their services. I can’t understand why new customer gets cheaper prices compared to existing customers online now showing 200MB for 26.92 whereas I use 100MB I was paying £33.

37,Shocking,"Received my email stating prices were going up and that I was able to leave without penalty….. music to my ears as I’ve been with VM almost 18 months which is the contract I took out…. In this time I have had my internet drop out weekly and receive sales and marketing calls upto 3 times per month who really dont like being told “no I don’t want to change my package’ so much so I have stopped answering my landline phone due to their bullying tactics at trying to get you to pay more money for your service!! I rung yesterday to cancel with them and the advisor at first was friendly and explained it was his job to keep me as a customer and offered me the same package as I have now but 99p cheaper per month I declined as I have decided to go back to the provider I was with 19 years prior to signing up with VM  … the only reason I left my previous supplier was we moved to a new build estate and they couldn’t supply me with broadband and phone at the time only a tv package thankfully things have changed and I can now get everything with previous supplier (sky) at my new address … the VM retentions team told me sky wouldn’t be able to handle the internet speed we need and he stated I could quote him on that it was never a problem in my previous 19 years with them!!! When I declined his offer of 99p reduction he put me on hold for the best part of 5 minutes then came back on the line AGAIN asking me not to leave and he can now reduce my bill by a further £7 per month I AGAIN declined to be put on hold again so when he came back on the line he proceeded to bad mouth sky to me and tell me if I didn’t return their equipment I would be charged £40 my reply that’s fine if you send me the packaging I will happily return now can I please cancel my service with yourselves he reluctantly did huffing and puffing at me down the phone. Thankfully I have received my cancellation confirmation via email, took me 40 minutes to cancel they really don’t want you to go once you’re with them !!

38,Worse internet and mobile company,"We got the 630MB speed, 5 months was excellent but the last 2 months the internet is crawling. It’s worse than the slowest we had before. It seems that this happened somehow to force us to upgrade to 1GB because for 2 months now we complain and call them every single day and they don’t even have an answer about why the internet became suddenly so slow. Some of the operators say the number of devices but we have less devices connected. Customer service is the worse I have ever experienced in a company. Avoid if you can. To the end of the day you will pay an excessive amount of money every month for a speed which you can have with the 1/4 of a price from another provider.",Ioannis Nanakas,2022,1,15,1,0.117,0.028,Negative

42,if I could give it zero stars I would,"if I could give it zero stars I would, avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs, I was stupid enough to sign up to a door to door salesman and it has been hands down the absolute worst customer experience ever. I have only been with them a couple of months. I tried to look at something relating to The Sopranos the other day as me and my sons are rewatching the entire series and couldn't because child lock is on.  You can remove child lock via the MyAccount function, except I cannot register for MyAccount, after inputting my surname, acct number, region code and completing the 'I am not a robot' captcha thing I kept getting defaulted to the beginning each time.  So I had to call and got their extremely complex automated messaging service which is a lottery, they simply do not want to speak to you and direct you to their 'hints and tips' online page or text you hints and tips or take you to an automated advice message and then hang up. I finally got into a queue by repeatedly hitting 1 when they asked me to press the key that related to 2nd 4th, 8th etc letter of my password.  I didn't know what my password was anyway as hadn't registered with my account yet and think my password was what the door to door salesman defaults you to when you sign up.  I finally spoke to a Nuresh, he took my name, email address, value of my direct debit, date my direct debit comes out and then asked for my bank account number and sort code, I told him I don't give my bank details over the phone.  He said OK, how can I help, I explained I wanted child lock removed, he said you can do it via MyAccount, I explained your MyAccount isn't working, it keeps defaulting me to the beginning each time I fill out the required information.  He said that as I had not completed verification as I wouldn't divulge my bank account details then he could not switch off child lock nor could he fix the MyAccount problem and that he had to write to me by letter so I could 'complete sercurities' I asked him to ask me an alternative verification question but he wouldn't and said you only get 1 attempt, I asked to speak to a manager, he refused, I was annoyed at this point and he hung up on me.  All I wanted was to remove child lock, I gave him 4 pieces of information to verify my identity.  After 3 hours of phone calls and tweets with their social media team (one of whom was rude and did not help, the other who was polite and courteous but still could not help) I gave up.

Toady we contacted VM and was told that there is no termination notice has been given from us and we will have to pay higher amount for our january/February bill.

Even though I moved before the next due payment, they forced me to pay the entire contract, but they did not agree to provide me with service in exchange for this money. Is a complete surprise. I'm not sure how this company can have such an impact on someone's life, because if I don't pay, my credit score may suffer.

A few days later i get an email offering me the s21 with a chromebook! You couldnt make this up if you tried!

91,Appalling Customer Service,"Call time - 10:13Call duration - 1 hour 41 minutesIssue - I received an email to state that the cost of my package was increasing by £8.50. On 12/01/22 I called Customer Services to see what options I had. They agreed that they would process a monthly discount of £8.50 on my account and as a result the cost of my package would be £89 until the end of my contract in July 2022. Today (13/01/2022) I received an email confirming the discount, but that my monthly charge would be £130.50 approx £40 more than what I was paying pre discount.On 13/01/2022 I called Virgin Customer Service and spoke to Liji based in the Mumbai Multi-Skills Team. I explained the issue as above, Liji asked whether I wanted a new deal, I said ""no"" and explained the issue again, Liji asked whether I had an issue with Broadband, I replied ""no"" and explained the issue again. Liji said I would need to be put through to the Retention Team. I said this isn't about retaining me as a Customer but a billing issue that I would expect a Customer Service Advisor to be able to investigate. Liji again offered to put me through to the Retention Team, I again declined and asked to be put through to Complaints, Liji advised that Complaints have to be made in writing. I then asked to speak to a supervisor, Liji advised that there were no Supervisors available. It was clear that Liji had no intention of assisting me and clearly wanted to pass me on so I was someone else's problem. It is some of the worst customer service I have experienced. In the end I had no option but to except the transfer to the Retention Team.I spoke to Brian in the Retention Team based in the Philippines. I explained the issue as above. Brian asked me whether I had an 02 sim, I said this is no and this is about my whole contract not just my mobile sim and explained the issue again. Brian clearly uninterested in helping me said I need to go through to Collections as this is a billing issue. I wasn't happy with that response, but again there was no willing on Brian's part to help me so he put me through.I spoke to Jum based in the Collections team in the Philippines, I explained the issue again. Jum advised that an upgrade has been made to my account which I have not asked for. I requested to know what he said he is unable to confirm an that I need to speak to the Customer Services team as he is unable to help. So I asked him to confirm that Retentions had passed me to Collections incorrectly and that the first Customer service advisor should not have passed me to retention team, he apologised.Back where I started 75 minutes later……This time in the Customer services team I spoke with Divya based in Bangalor. Divya stated that I had recontracted for £130.50, I stated that is absolutely 100% incorrect. My contract which commenced on 6th January 2021 is my first contract with Virgin, I have not made any amendments to the package the only thing that has been changed is the £8.50 discount applied to the account on the 12th January 2022 which was for the remained of my current deal. Divya stated that because they applied an £8.50 discount to my package all my other discounts were removed resulting in me paying around £40 more a month. I stated that during the call on 12th, at no point did the advisor state that I would lose my discounts and stated more than once that my bills would remain at £89 per month. I said I need this rectified.Divya confirmed that a manual adjustment has been process on my account to bring my bills back down to £89.The Customer Service provided by Liji, Brian and Jum is completely unacceptable. It felt like they were not interested in helping me. Liji tried but my problem wasn't one on the script in front of him. All three just wanted to pass me on. The query should have been resolved within 20 minutes but I was on the phone for almost 2 hours.",Chris Power,2022,1,13,1,0.072,0.042,Negative
92,Virgin Media - Customer service is shocking.,"I have recently signed up with Virgin media and I am very disappointed and the customer service that I have received during my on-boarding process has been absolutely abysmal. I was referred to Virgin media by a friend and I was sent a referral link . I had some questions about the contract so I contacted the sales team via the phone . I asked the sales agent twice during the sales call about referral and he assured me that I can add the referral, post-sale - he said something along the lines of ‘customer service are able to add this after the call, I don’t see why not’. I finalised the sale over the phone only on the basis that the referral would be added. It would have been easier and much quicker for me to complete the sale on the website. The call was recorded so please check the sales call and you will hear me ask about the referral on two occasions and you will be able to hear that I am told referrals can be added later. It was on this promise that I signed up for Virgin media via the phone. The sales agent should have added it for me on the call as I have now found out, the hard way.After trying to add my referral in my account as I was told, I found that this is not possible. Ahh well, I was told by the agent that this can be added by customer service… right? I logged a complaint via VM complaint portal and I was told that the complaints team are unable to add referrals and that I need to contact the customer service team via the phone and also another team called ‘Aklamio’. At this point, I already felt that this was very long winded and had the sales agent asked for the referral code over the phone, I could have saved time… anyway, it couldn’t get much worse could it? After all the complaints department have told me to contact customer service and Aklamio to resolve this… right?After waiting 15 minutes in a queue on the phones, I finally get through to customer service. They advise me that they can’t add referrals after the sales call, the sales agent should have added it.. but the sales agent told me I can do and this was the ONLY reason I completed the sale via the phone rather than the link I had been sent by my friend? The customer service agent then tells me that I must contact Aklamio and they can get this resolved for me.I am already very very unhappy at this point as I have been told something different every time I have contacted a Virgin media department, but everyone has mentioned Aklamio, so they will finally put an end to this and complete the very simple step of adding my referral… right?After back and forth emails with Aklamio, they have told me they can’t, and more importantly, will not, ‘pay out’ for a referral that was not added by a sales agent. They told me there is nothing they can do and that to get this resolved I must contact Virgin medias customer service team. What on earth is going on. I am so angry about this, I am being passed around different departments because not one of the customer service agents can be bothered to resolve what I deem a very very very simple query. No one can be bothered to acknowledge that the sales agent has clearly made a mistake on the phone and are instead putting this on me as if this is my own fault. I have worked in customer service for many years and this should be a very simple request, I have maintained a friendly approach to everyone I have interacted with, but I am at the end of my wick now. This is absolutely ridiculous.All that is required is that one of the customer service agents listens to the sales call and they will hear me ask the sales agent on two occasions about the referral. I was told to add it after the call… it is therefore not my fault that the referral hasn’t been added, this is on Virgin media. I am unhappy that I am being treated like I have made a mistake.I really hope that someone with sense reads this review, completes the very simple task of listening back to the sales call, hearing me very clearly ask the sales agent about referral and being told that this can be added after the call. I do not have any issue with the sales agent, he made a mistake; everyone does. I am infuriated by the customer service team being unable to resolve this very simple query and shirking their responsibility by funnelling me through different departments in the hope that I just go away.Please please can someone just resolve this for me so that I can move forward. At the point of sale I was told the wrong information, this is not my fault and I am unhappy that I am being penalised for it. Please can a manager reach out to me via email or call me after 6:15pm and I will be happy to get this sorted out 😊 This whole process has taken up lots of my time and it all could have been avoided if the sales agent just took down the referral code over the phone. If I do not hear from anyone, I will be forced to log a formal complaint",Kyle SM,2022,1,13,1,0.083,0.076,Negative
93,Incompetent customer service and 1gb isnt really ready,"With the upcoming increase in charges I decided to upgrade to Virgin medias 1 gb broadband. Several phone calls and every time I was sent an incorrect contract. Extra charges added, incorrect monthly fees. I am now on my 4th version of the contract and hope finally it is what was agreed on the telephone. With the upgrade from 500 to 1gb I was still only receiving around 500 mbs. Told a different story by every agent I spoke to.  Eventually I got an engineer to visit who quickly told me the firmware of the Hub 4 isnt yet able to transmit the 1gb by WIFI and they will trial later this month and earliest it will be available will be end of February. So I was sold something that isnt actually ready. The engineer told me they had several visits that day to tell 1gb customers the same story. I cancelled the 1gb and asked to go back to my old contract. Not possible you need to downgrade and take another 18 months contract. So in summary, if you want 1gb and use wireless then its just not ready yet. Customer service is poor. Agents tell you what they think you want to hear to get you off the phone. What you agree on the phone is not what they then contract you for. Beware.",Rob D,2022,1,13,1,0.059,0.054,Negative
94,Very pleased with the service,"Very pleased with the service. I received an email notification about a price increase to fund investment in improving the service. It was £4/month, no big deal but not a big fan of having things imposed on me. Anyway, phoned customer service and an automated message offered me the £4 back off my bill. Thought it was a bit strange and a little underhand, particularly for all the customers who are too busy to phone in. Anyway I went ahead to cancel my account (because of the principle and moral objectives to this approach). All fine, helpful agents. Few days later I get a call offering me a further £12 off my monthly bill! Nice, but I stuck with my moral objection. Appreciated the offer though. Anyway, another 2 days later, got another phone call...another £3 off/month! After a brief conversation with my inner morality I decided to forgive them for this little hiccup in an otherwise excellent service and I am signed up for another 18 months.

99,"Review of VM internet, and customer services","I am a fiber broadband VM customer - 350mb for £480 a year - and am soon to leave.My experience has been very poor over the past 18 months.I switched from Sky due to VM being the only provider in my area (London) offering fiber.The initial installation was bundled resulting in multiple internet drop out per day, and low DL/UL speeds. After contacting VM multiple times (see below) the 3rd engineer visit improved the problem. The reason was because of an incorrect installation.VM charge you to call their customer service team. They have a messaging system on their website which can take 24 hours for them to respond to your enquiry. You need stable internet for this to work, which is ironic if your problem is an unstable connection. Once through you receive staple cut and paste solutions, and its difficult to consult with a technical expert or to book an engineer.Their help and support pages on their website are difficult to navigate, and often loop you back to the last page. It's almost as if they don't want you to contact them, otherwise why not offer a convenient messaging service, offers to call you back, or free to phone contact numbers?Since the initial resolution my internet drops out each day for a couple minutes around 10am.I spend 52 minutes on the phone this week trying to cancel my contract. I was told I couldn't be transferred to their cancellation team because of a technical issue. I was promised they would call me back. They didn't.I called the next day and spoke with an extremely rude and patronising agent who tried to discredit the service provider I intend to move to, and told me I was one of their lucky customers who could get a £16 discount per month off an increased cost which was £16 more per month than I was spending at the moment. Funny that! How lucky I felt.When I told her I still intended to leave she told me her offer was the 'best you're going to get mate' and basically hung up on me. I had more questions and was rushed off the call (I paid for) so she could, I imagine, kindly offer another customer a discount off an inflated, imaginary cost, which would, I imagine, serve only to extend the customers misery.Oh, the hub 3 is very poor quality. And I had to buy a mesh WiFi router and put the hub into modem mode.In conclusion it's a dismal tide to see companies like VM operating with such poor service, technically, and such absent or obnoxious customer service. Does the UK not have a regulator for this kind of thing? Anyway like a bad dream it's behind me now (well, soon to be) so I can finally sleep well and give my hard earned money to someone else. Half per year actually, for 3x the speed. A company with excellent ratings on trustpilot.My advice is avoid VM practically and in principle.",Briggs,2022,1,13,1,0.101,0.096,Negative
100,5 years of unreliable service in London,"Do not subscribe to virgin media unless you relish exasperation and an unreliable service.  Have been using virgin broadband for 5 years in London.  Service is unreliable and router often needs restarting.  Sometimes service disappears for hours.  Virgin's standard response is to explain they are upgrading equipment in our area for a better customer experience.   I cancelled Virgin last November, the cancellation process was awful.  Customer services forgot to activate the cancellation and billing continued.  It took hours of calls to customers services to get the cancellation back dated to my original call.Since leaving Virgin Media have switched to Community Fibre.  For the first time in 5 years we've had a 100% reliable broadband connection.  No drop outs or router restarts.

If you live in a two bed flat you will still need to buy signal boosters in order to have internet in all the rooms.Your inbox will be crammed with spam on a weekly basis, it doesn't matter if you have unsubscribed to them, you will still keep receiving them. They also pass you personal details to other companies without your consent for marketing for sure (I have received ""surveys"" on behalf of Virgin from companies I had not given my details to), and probably for other reasons as well.I had Talk Talk in the past and was quite happy with their low fees and steady, reliable signal, good customer service.

157,Will never use Virgin Media again.,"Virgin Media customer for over 13 years, but the prices kept going up and the service kept getting worse. Every couple of years, when our contract expired, they made us go through the stupid routine of threatening to leave just so they'd let us speak to a customer retention rep who was authorised to give us a fair deal.For years they've refused to upgrade our Superhub - we're stuck with the first generation model, which is horribly out of date, so I just had to buy a third party wifi router to make it work properly. Trying to convince them to switch us onto a broadband only package because we no longer needed a TV & Landline bundle was all but impossible. They wanted to charge £70+ for a package that was advertised at under £50 for new customers, when new competitors were offering faster broadband at lower prices. It took a 30 minute conversation with a rep to discover that the price I thought I'd be paying was not for existing customers.So we switched to Community Fibre - much faster, much cheaper. But trying to actually quit Virgin Media, even though our contract has expired, has been a painful nightmare. You can't do it through the website (which is embarrassingly slow and clunky for a tech business) and have to call or post a letter.I tried calling, got put on hold for half an hour, and eventually got through to an offshore call centre - with a bad line (another win for a telecoms provider!) and a rep with a very thick accent who had trouble understanding me. After four attempts he still couldn't take my account number, so I gave up and posted a letter with all the details to the address listed for cancellations on the website. But, of course, they claim to have never received the letter and continued billing us. So we called again. And again - offshore call centre, thick accents, poor connection, all round difficulties in communicating. But after being put on hold endlessly and bounced around different reps, we finally managed to explain that we were ending the contract. Of course, Virgin being Virgin, they've gouged us for a couple of months payments since we stopped using their service. And they expect us to return the obsolete, worthless Superhub to them.While that stings, I'm just glad to be rid of them - I'll never use Virgin Media again, and I'm going to spend the rest of today posting this review on every site where it might help to warn others.",Lance Concannon,2022,1,12,1,0.138,0.05,Negative

When you try and leave they make it as hard as they can and you are constantly put through to someone else to deal with it but no one actually does. Expensive for what it is, I was paying £72 for basic TV, phone and a low bb package. Now moved to a different company, so much better bb, speed consistent and reaches everywhere and alot cheaper.VM even replied to a previous review asking me to check my wifi speed using a wired connection...Checking your WiFi speed through a wired connection is defeating the object! I was offered boosters at my expense which would have brought my package to well over £100 for the basic package I had. Extremely poor on existent customer service.

193,the worst company I ever had to deal with,"It is really hard to start. Was Virgin customer for a year, then I wasn't informed my contract was ending and price was increased even that I had some special offer available, so I had to argue with them for a month to get special offer applied. Once that was done, I still was getting £60 bills (meant to be £40) and was calling, texting and using their live chat day by day, week by week and was only sending from department to department but nobody was able to do anything. Finally after 3 or 4 months of constant fight my offer was applied and contract extended for another year. Let's go to advertised 350Mb Fibre... which is not Fibre. Fibre cable is going only to main cabinet on the street, it is not connected to household so it's not reliable at all. My 350Mb broadband was usually no more than 120Mb. At the beginning I've tried to raise it with them but nothing had happened anyway so I gave up. The real nightmare started few days ago when I informed them I want to resign from my contract (I was already in fee-free resignation period). First I've spent over 2hrs with lady on live chat - she wasn't much helpful and acted like a child. I told her 2 or 3 times I want to quit and her only answer was 'but I want you to stay' or 'I don't want to lose you'... I can guess they're getting really good bonuses for keeping customer with Virgin however I had already contract signed with different company installing proper Fibre to the household so I've explained her kindly again there is nothing she can do to keep her and asked to confirm all is done in 20min before I'll be late to work. She was playing with a time, and kept me on the line but finally said she cancelled all, issued last bill and I'll get a confirmation of service cancellation in next 48hrs (it is already 4th day and still didn't get anything). Meantime I had 3 calls from Virgin Media trying to keep me with a company - looks like Virgin Media cannot accept 'No' as an answer especially I gave them 3 reasons why I am leaving so price, quality of their service and customer service poor skills. Today another phone call, another customer and another who cannot understand 'No I won't stay'. When I tried to ask him when finally I'll get confirmation of cancellation he just hang up. Their customer service reps are really rude and definitely not qualified to speak with customers... They asked me to send back their devices until the end of January during my first conversation on the live chat with them and if no returned I will have to pay them fine. Can someone explain me how I can return something when I even didn't get any confirmation and instruction how to do it, no address no place to drop, nothing! Waste of time , money and nerves... Definitely will never come back and won't recommend to anyone.",Paulina,2022,1,11,1,0.087,0.095,Positive

Months later and I've had no contact, when tried to contact virgin they advised that I have too many devices and that's why it's slow.

Mainly because I spoke to the 'wrong' people at virgin. I didn't always understand what was being said when I spoke to the Indian call centre. And I have Indian friends.I believe I decided that I couldn't afford to pay both bt and virgin, so I rang up to cancel the virgin contract 2_days before Christmas!That was when I spoke to someone who would listen to me?Oh yes. They would send out an engineer to connect me the day after boxing day.An engineer came a few days after boxing day and after seeing my predicament, had to come back a week later. He was very efficient and did a good job. So. Today , on the 11th January, I have at last disconnected from bt.

200,Worst company I've ever dealt with,"Where to begin... - I get 20mbps broadband speed despite the advertised 'average' being 100. - Wifi connection routinely drops out and I have to wait for it to connect again (ruins streaming)- Poor wifi coverage in the house- If I'm ever doing something really important or making a purchase I will tether to the 4g on my phone as it's far quicker and more reliable- Every time the contract ends they increase the price by a vast amount and you have to spend 8 hours on the phone threatening to leave before they reduce it- Their customer service is beyond description. It takes hours to speak to anyone via any medium and then when you finally do they are wilfully unhelpful. It's like talking to a chatbot in real life where they don't understand what you're saying and read prepared responses from a script that aren't relevant hoping you'll give up in frustration. Which you do, as that is your only choice.It doesn't look like any of the other traditional suppliers are any better but if you get the opportunity to avoid ever having to deal with Virgin Media that can only be a good thing.",Thomas Mangione,2022,1,11,1,0.053,0.088,Positive

202,The mafia has more integrity,"Wish I could give them a zero. Was a costumer for many years, but had to cancel my contract because I was moving and my current place already has another internet provider. They asked me to return my router kit, which I did and kept the receipt as proof since I'm aware of how shady they are as a company. Yodel website states that they've received my equipment on the 6th of December. They have been harassing me for over a month now saying that I didn't return the kit and that they will charge me £40 for it. After contacting Virgin's costumer service many times to no avail, and getting a bill on the first of January, I filled a complaint with the ISPA. A week later, I got a call from Aimee, from the executive team, to try and resolve the issue. She apologise profusely for everything and said she would take care of everything, and that I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. You would think that after that the issue would be settled, right? Wrong. The very next day, I received another email (and then a letter by post a few days later), telling me that I owe Virgin Media £40 from a previous bill (what for? Not specified, of course) and that I have 20 days to pay for it.I've now given up on trying to reason with them and will escalate my complaint with the ISPA. They're probably trying to wear me down and force me to pay £40 for equipment I've already returned, but I would rather spent thousands of pounds taking them to court than allowing them to extort any more money out of me.

270,"Virgin Media lied to me, mis sold. Avoid!","I have accessed the money supermarket web site to check for broadband deals.  Found a deal from Virgin Media with the £24 per month, 100MB speed, unlimited internet, free setup and £75 voucher. I clicked to take the offer and I was redirected to Virgin Media web site where I put all my details including my phone number and email address. In the very next day, I received a call from a guy which presented himself to be Virgin Media representative and he is responsible for my area. I do not remember his name however his phone number is: 07305540105. He informed me that my address doesn’t have the line with the Virgin Media, and it will take up to 3 months to make the connection. I agreed as long the offer will remain the same and he assured me that nothing will change. Happy days! The same person took my bank details for direct debit setup and came to my address to make all the measurements for cable connection.When the connection has been made I haven't received or signed any contracts. Then my first bill came and I’ve been charged £29 per month and £35 fee for setup. Tried to call the person I talked to on the phone and there is no answer, only Virgin Media voice mail responding. I haven’t received any emails from Virgin Media except one with the £75 voucher confirmation. I've tried to make an account on their web site but they had my email address incorrect and I really believe that was on purpose so I could not be able to receive the contract, I asked multiple times to be corrected but unsuccessful, it's still incorrect.I have contacted multiple times their customer service trying to fix my problem but without results. I asked to speak with a manager which offered me a refund for connection fee, the difference which I paid extra for every month and he promised to change the contract to be £24 as it should be. I received the refund but the contract it's still the same and no £75 voucher.After about 6 months I changed my address and I asked them to move my service to the new address and guess what, they made me a new contract for another 18 months after around 1 year I'll have to pay £51 otherwise I'll be charged for early disconnection fee. I've checked in the contract and it written that if the services are exactly the same for the new address then the contract will remain the same and a new contract shouldn't be issued unless you'll chance the contract condition which it's not my case.I'm still wasting plenty of my time and nerves trying to fix my problem.

But on install day you don't get the extenders, forced to wait 5 days to order 1 extender. Then wait for that to be delivered and another 5 days before you can order another, and so it goes on. I did complain and get a credit on my first bill, but I would have preferred easier access to the extenders that their engineers agreed were needed to get full service, instead of all the hassle. Virgin tv has been OK so far, broadband has had to be reset several times. Better bandwidth than previous supplier, who couldn't upgrade us to the service level we required due to difficulties installing their fibre to our house. So, in many ways we were forced to take this option, as other options were limited.

If you're lucky enough to have alternatives, I'd consider them very seriously.Update for VM response:  Thanks Kath for the reply - it's reassuring to know there are folk at VM who do really care still, but it changes nothing regarding my recent experience as a long-term customer.I originally requested and confirmed (via 150 call) a simple TV service reduction change in August 2021 that never got implemented. Four months (and four months charges for a service I no longer want) later I'm still trying to get that simple service reduction, in spite of multiple attempts and even a formal complaint which was closed unsatisfactorily against my wishes.In the spirit of a new year and (wishfully) a new start I tried again via live chat (screen recorded) on 9 January - to simply be held waiting for over 70 mins with no response before giving it up as a lost cause.So 1-star remains a fair and balanced assessment of my recent personal customer experience.",Steve Archbold,2022,1,9,1,0.092,0.11,Positive

331,A nightmare switch from BT to Virgin..the story so far,"Since moving over from BT only a few months ago we have not been impressed by the service we have found with Virgin media. The connection levels with the broadband/WiFi within my home has diminished recognisable. Where before we have had seemless connection to each of our devices, we have now found this to be unreliable and inconsistent. It regularly loses the VPN connection when my wife and I are working from home together. This has been extremely frustrating and stressful for us. A call was made to customer services and a slight improvement was felt but not anywhere near the level we had from BT.The Tivo tv box has taken a bit of getting use to and we have excepted this will take time. We don't have too much of an opinion at this stage as a result. Overall, At this rate or without significant improvements to the broadband service we will leave as soon as our contract expires. I had virgin media services in my home more than a decade ago and was very impressed hence I thought I give it a go once again. So far this i feel has been a mistake. If someone from virgin would like to get in touch to discuss these issues I would be grateful.",Ronnie docherty,2022,1,9,2,0.092,0.043,Negative
332,Terrible service,"Terrible service. I have had intermittent connection and download speeds much less than I have paid for, for four years on both the 350,MB/s and 200 MB/s. The slow speeds and dropping out of connection is always blamed on the customer by Virgin. What they don't tell you, the Hub 3 is only designed to carry between 8-10 devices. So a family of five, like mine, are never going to be sufficiently serviced with a suitable broadband connection - especially when working from home. As there is no other option because the BT line is not fibre optic - I upgraded to the 1 Gig package with the new Hub 4. After one week - the download speeds were exactly the same as the download speeds I was getting from the 200MB/s package. In that week, I was notified of the pending price increase in March for all customers. I contacted Virgin to discuss - what an effort this was. In total, I have spent around 8 hours trying to sort issues ralating to download speeds and paying for a service I am not receiving. I spent three and a half hours on the online chat - I asked six times to cancel the 1 Gig package. This was repeatedly ignored and I was given options I did not want. In the end the Agent just put me through to customer relations and I spent 90 minutes waiting for contact from that team. No contact was forthcoming. So I ended the call. I tried again on the following day. I spent sixty minutes waiting for an agent. Again no response. I tried the day after and again after going through initial questions and stating I wanted to cancel - no response. After 60 minutes I called the telephone customer service. As an interesting note - I kept the online chat open and still no response 24 hours later. I called the customer service line - I told the Agent that my download speeds were very low. The agent was not interested - if I could not undertake an ethernet test. I tried to cancel the package and revert back to the previous 200MB/s package - because the download speeds were the same. I was told I would have to pay more now for the 200MB/s package now. Unbelievable. After one hour of wasting my time - I was put through to cancellations. I eventually cancelled the 1Gig package to a lower package; but was told my next bill would be £110 - this would include £35 set up fees for the initial 1 Gig package and difference in that price compared to my initial package - one was 46.50 and the other £62. I told the Agent I would not be paying above the £46.50 I would usually be paying. I told the Agent I was not paying for a service I had not received. I also told the Agent I would not pay £35 set up charge for a package that has been cancelled. And I told the Agent it had taken nearly 8 hours for me to cancel a simple broadband package. The response was - put me on hold for about fifteen minutes. I was told to contact the billing team. I did and had to go through the same story again. I was put on hold again for over fifteen minutes and I then terminated the call. In total a further two hours plus wasted yesterday. Virgin media just make it up as they go along. Poor customer services and slow speeds which are much slower than the advertised packages; AND Virgin media maker life very difficult to cancel.",Chris Dodds,2022,1,9,1,0.088,0.012,Negative

I then waited 5 hours(!!) for a response via WhatsApp for the agent to tell me I can't cancel over live chat.

Just over a month later, at my new address, my telephone, tv and broadband service was unexpectedly disconnected. When I contacted customer service I was informed that my services had been suspended due to an unpaid bill for the previous month. When I enquired when and why my bank had declined the payment request I was told that there was no direct debit mandate in place! They could not explain why my previous direct debit set up had been removed, apologised for this and then set one up again. I expressed my great dissatisfaction over the fact that I had not been sufficiently informed of the issue and given an opportunity to address it before being cut off. No clear emails had been sent to alert me to the unpaid bill, and no additional letters had been sent or even phone calls made to bring it to my attention in order to cover all communication bases. I am an elderly and vulnerable individual who relies heavily on my telephone and television service and to suddenly find them cut off without adequate warning was upsetting and less than acceptable!I was assured that I would receive a written letter confirming that a new direct debit mandate had been set up so that the issue would not reoccur.

I get 380mbps, just as promised with the initial sign up.

If you plan on getting Virgin, and you have a decent sized home, maybe think about getting some access points, or shine sort of device to extend your wi-fi services across your home.

401,Avoid! Awful customer service - Liars!,I’m only using virgin media because I have no other option in the area. Their customer service is an absolute joke run by liars and untrained incompetent staff. They made several mistakes on my account from my initial sign up. Because of them I had no internet connection for several days and I work from home! They lied about sending out my router - no one had sent it out for several days. Not only that but they lied about creating my account to the correct address so they had to close the account then create a new one. This meant they had to do two hard credit checks on my name which affected my credit score. They lied and said the credit checks would be soft searches and won’t effect my score. This is just the tip of the iceberg. They made so many mistakes when all they had to do is set me up as a new customer and send me a router. Virgin media are not to be trusted. When I raised a complaint with them they tried to make me feel bad for it and offered me rubbish compensation which does not make up for the stress caused and time lost. I spent a whole week on the phone with these fools trying to sort out all the issues. They are over-priced and I don’t think it’s even worth the money. I paid much less with Sky broadband and had the same level of service but with an added bonus of helpful customer service team I could rely on and trust.,Mh,2022,1,7,1,0.154,0.108,Negative

December Bill arrived double of what I should be charged. Called customer service several times and no one seem to understand this bill. They close the complaint once without resolution. Last call this week and I am told its billing language error and the package charge is actually charge from month of November. Virgin adds new charges in bills on & off and every time I have to fight back. Its as if they check if the charge will go unnoticed.Get your billing straight as its frustrating!

I moved into my new home on the 18th November and had my TV box delivered on 16th as I thought that was my moving date but was delayed. The day after a friend who is very IT savvy tried to connect everything up to no avail and we had to ring, the day after a technician arrived to find the TV box was faulty and fitted a new one, that packed up 2 days later and I had to wait with no TV for days to be told the 2nd one was also faulty, by which time it was into the 2nd week since delivery. The Broad band and land line have given no concern at all and I hoped all was well and asked for a 2nd TV box for my kitchen only to be informed it would cost another £10a month. I accepted but told the technician if I had any more problems that would be it and I would cancel the TV service. After he had gone I watched the one in the lounge but then tried the kitchen one only to find the sound and picture were not syncronised so unwatchable then the remote on the other one stopped working. That was the last straw and I got in touch by phone to cancel the TV service and had it disconnected the day after. Although I had hardly any hours of TV time from the so called service the 2 weeks from delivery had passed a week of which was spent waiting for technicians I was told the cooling off period had passed. I must have spoken to at leased a dozen people complaining, I had no instructions on how to use the equipment the technology of which is beyond me unless I have instructions to read, and you have the audacity to call that experience a service. I asked for boxes and labels to send back everything and confirmation of where I stood with my contract, but as usual none of that has materialised.It is the 6th of January. I spoke to several people on the 7th and 9th December and heard nothing since or received any communication from Virgin Media, and you expect  a review well you have one now.

I would not recommend their broadband to anyone, especially if you plan to move home soon. The way they have dealt with our house move has been a complete time and money waste.To name a few of our 'lowlights':- It was very hard to get hold of an engineer to deal with our technical issues when we first moved. After an hour of preliminary questions (e.g. turn the router off and on again), VM said we needed to speak to a technician before an engineer could come to our address. Within in their stated 48 hr window, the technician never called... so we rang VM again and had to start the process from square one (customer service would not look at the notes on our account and deviate from their scripts). It took a week after our move in date to finally get an engineer around to sort it out. Side note: the engineer was great.- When we moved home they created a new account and put us on a new, more expensive contract. VM promised we would not be charged anymore than at our previous address, but their billing system is flawed. They take out the new rate £51 from our account and then eventually refund back the credit to make the difference? They refuse to adjust the DD to old amount, so now we have to make one-off payments every month.- We raised a complaint and VM said they would call back within 48 hours. After a week later I received a call from their complaints department, he said he could not access their system at the time and would call me back in 10 minutes. The call never came.These are only a few of the negative, hair-pulling experiences I have had with them. More experiences include poor phone connection that cuts-out, false promises, inexperienced staff, late payment charges,unclear breakdown of bills etc. I honestly cannot wait until our contract ends - I am counting down the months!",HD,2022,1,6,1,0.067,0.043,Negative

And not hikes that match rate of inflation but like significant hikes that don't seem to have justifications. Every year I've called Virgin and said I'll change providers but they offer me a competitive price to stay but this year the Customer Service Provider was abrupt and rude in his handling of my case, saying there's no need to question a price rise, a company does what it wants and if I have a problem with that I can leave but will be risking moving to an untrustworthy company.

If your issue isn’t on their script then you will get no help whatsoever. My issue was concerning a bereavement and the bereavement team seemed to be helpful but didn’t actually do what they said they’d do.  The telephone line frequently has issues and isn’t actually working correctly now - but I can’t face raising the issue with Virgin and their loopy scripts that get to nowhere, just round and round in circles.  I would never recommend Virgin to anyone in fact I would say ‘Stear Clear’.  Mainly due to the terrible Customer Service.

Some of the staffs in virgin media are liars as well , they promise to give you a call back and the rest is history. I am never ever in my this, another and alter life, i am using this broadband.  I would rather go to the cave and start medidation. The amount of frustation i had dealing for this last 6 months to get my account sorted has drained me mentally.

He asked me to confirm my contact information three times. He kept saying I had internet service when I didn’t, my catch up and on demand services were also an issue. In the end I refused to reset the box and hub again because it wasn’t helping and was like I was smacking my head against a brick wall. They have to compensate me for lack of service and they will do anything they can to get out of this. I asked for an engineer to come out but I was told they won’t be doing that.

I constantly get the same excuses about connectivity issues that should be fixed after 24 hours etc. and instructions to reboot my modem. Sometimes they go away to do ""technical checks"" and the line just goes dead! I believe VM are knowingly making grossly inaccurate, or even blatantly false claims about their internet speeds and it is high time OFCOM dealt with them.Edit; Note the same cut and pasted reply below that they always leave with the same advice to do the same old things that have already failed to yield any results. I repeat, It is my opinion that VMs network is not capable of delivering the speeds they claim and they are in breach of the law in knowingly making these false claims. OFCOM should be dealing with them.

I tried to change the dd date but the customer service wouldn’t change it as they tried to change me £50 just to change the date, which during covid did not help at all. We have no/ very little internet and on top of that you are charging me £96 for late payment fees. And won’t even set my direct debit back up. I can’t even login to my account or contact you as I can never get through. I have put a complaint in before but no one had even acknowledged it. Due to the inconvenience that random charge of £96. And internet problems. I am really frustrated and not happy with virgin media! .This meant that Unfair pricing with no internet. I could pay BT £25 a month and have reliable internet but unfortunately stuck with virgin media’s slow and unreliable internet for £43 a monthIn order to resolve my issue I would like you to Remove the charge and re set up my direct debit and lower the dd price otherwise will go with someone else once we move house .",ewelina witer,2022,1,4,1,0.217,0.053,Negative

Your Rep said the £35.00 set up fee would be returned as there was nothing to do, we are still waiting. We were told that the first weeks payment would be returned it has not. Your engineer said we would need a second router, as we had previously with Sky, 4 months on we still haven’t recieved that, consequently we are paying for something that isn’t fit for purpose.

560,Always find Virginia a good,"Always find Virginia a good, reliable and fast service with a decent after sales service. My gripe is that the introductory deal is great til it runs out.. then I just swap servers for their deal. Seems to me that Virginia, like other servers, are doing deals then rely on lazy people to make bigger profits and this needs to be addressed. If Virginia offered a deal that was fixed for a longer time, even if it was a bit more than the introductory deal, then I think they'd not have such a turnover of customers. I find Virginia up there with the best service as I've now tried most but fundamentally, if you are making a profit from me now it kinda sticks in the throat to see the service charge jump .",Neil,2022,1,3,4,0.013,0.111,Positive
561,To be honest I'm disappointed with the Broadband,"To be honest I'm disappointed with several key aspects after my switch from Sky to Virgin.Broadband: Direct cable into my house fantastic, performance = Awful. When connected a month ago, speed tested by installation engineer over 500mb, I confirmed this speed several times with a speed test app, last couple of weeks around 200mbs. broadband range throughout the 3 bedroom house poor. Even after trying to optimise the settings with the Virgin Connect App. Sky Fibre Broadband to the street main cabinet then copper cable to the house was at 50mb and available throughout the whole house, even to the detached garage with a tp link.The Virgin speed sounds impressive, but if the signal is poor what's the point, and I'm not running any additional connections.So my question to Virgin is why is the Broadband so awful????Secondly, the TV has similar features to Sky, but if you want to watch any BBC program from the start, then you have to open up the BBC iPlayer, a poor second to the Sky system.I was looking forward to an excellent experience, which I was had told my work colleagues and friends about, as we will be working from home a lot in 2022 and some can only dream about 50mb speed let alone 500, due to their location.I hope you take this feedback in the manner that its intended and reach out to me to solve the Broadband issue, even if there is nothing that can be done with the TV.Yours sincerely",New customer ,2022,1,3,2,0.063,0.125,Positive

And the reason, is because they wanted my notice to expire, before my old supplier couldn’t offer me a better deal. Totally unethical and completely deliberate, hence being charged by both providers.Complete farce, once they get you to sign up, they don’t follow up. We had many phone calls, they didn’t process the switch and we ended up with a unnecessary bill. They promised to reimburse it via a credit, never happened either?! One fob off after another, totally outrageous.We chased everything, seriously could have done a better and cheaper job signing up online. The sale rep was a complete cowboy. We are still chasing the fee from our previous supplier which they promised to cover and the monthly credit which the rep stipulated in the quote. We are paying more than the online deal as the rep quoted a monthly price and a supposed monthly credit, yeah right, still chasing.

Contract is coming to an end and without me realising the price will go up by £20 a month. Hoped I could renegotiate a deal or get similar to what was offered to ""New"" customers. That didn't happen so looked elsewhere and have now got deal with another company for 150 Fibre (100Mbps guaranteed) for a little more than I what I had been paying Virgin. I still have to pay Virgin 30 days notice at their new grossly inflated price.(That's my fault, though I suppose ) Customer service and communication is poor at best and at times impossible.Edit: Well Virgin called me and James offered me an upgrade  and a better deal, so I've accepted and cancelled the change to other provider. So at the end of the day I have twice the speed for less than if I moved. The whole process could have been so much easier. It's annoying to have been with a company and you have to leave to get deals that are offered to ""new"" customers. Changed to 3 stars.

Promised to send me the voice recording of one of the many support calls, never received.They still don't have my recompense correct so will once again need to phone support.Awful customer service.Update 4th Jan: Received a standard response from VM including ""We understand that installs can be frustrating when they're delayed. A lot of the time the delay is caused by waiting on correct permits to be filed by the local council. Apologies that your install was rescheduled multiple times.""Had anyone bothered to properly reach out to me, they would know the issues were caused by Virgins poor operational process, nothing to do with permits. It was only me chasing and co-ordinating that got the install completed. It was only me chasing and co-ordinating that got the install completed along with turning up unannounced.They have then let me know how i can contact them to resolve my recompense issues. Why not get someone to call me?  I was promised several times someone senior from VM is going to call me to run through my issues - nothing.If you are looking at Sky Vs VirginMedia, based on my experience, Sky is more expensive but worth paying the extra for simply for their better support.I reiterate, VM support is very poor.

648,Virgin's disgusting customer service.,"My broadband with Virgin went up to £82/month so I decided it was time to switch. I found a deal with NOW broadband for £20/month, 12-month contract. I decided to give Virgin a call first to see if I could get a better deal with them. They offered a couple of deals (£28 & £44/month), both 24-month contract, so I decided to go with NOW and cancelled Virgin.After a week of slow speeds and sketchy connections, I decided to ditch NOW before the 14-day cooling off period ended, and find something more reliable. I realised that I might have to extend to an 18-month contract to get a reasonable deal and noticed that Virgin was now offering 18-month contracts. So, I decided to give them another call.They said they could re-connect. I asked if they could give me a good price on an 18-month contract. Virgin said we could talk about deals after they re-connect. I asked about cancelling within 14 days. They said there would be a small charge for usage, so I decided to go ahead. Later that day I received an email form Virgin saying they would be coming the next day to install and my first bill would be £44.35 and then settle down to £60.75/month.The following day I called Virgin and they said this was just an estimate and we can still talk about deals later, so I agreed to go ahead. I felt uneasy, so I called Virgin again to just to confirm. I was then told that if I cancelled, albeit within the 14-day period, I would be billed for £44.35 + £60.75 even for 1 or 2 days usage.

However, he didn't seem to know I had 2 TiVo boxes, (one in the bedroom).He couldn't remove the 2nd box from the contract due to technical difficulties, as we felt we didn't need it. He promised to phone me back  - he didn't.I then received an e-mail stating that the new contract at £99.00 per month was in place. Unfortunately something I hadn't agreed to. I phoned Virgin and agreed to the contract to save spending another 45 minute wait to get through ever again.We moved house and had been promised 200mbs broadband speed which never got above 50mbs. We had also for some reason lost the movies. My other box for the bedroom was also not connected.Another wait on the phone and was told I had the complete wrong package and that I didn't have a 2nd TiVo box, I said well I have had one in my bedroom for the last 4 years and still have it. I was then told I was on a 500mbs contract not 200, however the speed only got to a tenth of that. I was beginning to think of claiming the compensation promised if the speed dropped too low on various occasions.The engineer turned up to connect my non-existent TiVo box in the bedroom and promised 200mbs which I then said what happened to the 500mbs??I have ended up paying an extra £13.00 per month, (£112.00), for broadband which is slower than I have had for the past 4 years and for movies which I already had previously.It is too stressful to argue with a non-existent customer service anymore as this happens whenever you may manage to get through to anybodySo after this contract after after many years - it's Goodbye Virgin!",Denis Dennehy,2021,12,28,1,0.074,0.063,Negative

For the past week I have had to tether from a Smarty SIM as the Hub 4 will not allow devices to connect (plus speed issues), when VM was confronted with this I was told ""sorry you have to many devices connected"" - I only have  the standard amount any family connects!! Question for VM, why can I tether all the devices from my mobile with no problems?  So as the VM hub 4 will only put up with 10 devices you will have to go out and spend 100's of pounds on a new router and turn the hub 4 into modem mode only!  When you contact VM they don't care, they either put you on infinite hold or put the phone down on you.  WIFI, VM told me this is only a feature and don't rely on it, so why on your ads do you put ""have WiFi technology designed to automatically fix connection issues and come in packages to suit any household.""? This is NOT TRUE! it is quite the opposite!! again tethering from a mobile phone is better and more reliable than you and oooo and before I forget it connects over ""WIFI"" - They reply below wow well VM I have nothing but been on the phone, I have submitted DSAR's for phone calls and notes on my account.",simon,2021,12,28,1,0.064,0.036,Negative

Please be careful what you have, the first 3 weeks on the M500 were fine with a hub 3( I think), I had no problems at all. I was upgraded for free as I am a virgin and O2 customer so I was sent a newer hub and given the gig broadband. Once this was plugged it I had constant issues, initially the hub was faulty (engineer came out), then a number of technical issues there end( engineer had to come out) then broadband kept going off during peak times which was frustrating so engineer came out again.I am hoping that all has now been rectified and I can become a happy customer but first impressions could not have been any worse.

Since installation last year I have had four outages in my area which took about 24 hours also to resolve/fix. They work on automated reimbursement scheme as well which means that the system calculates if I’m eligible for a refund due to the outage based on the duration of time it took to fix. Conveniently it never has felt that I am due a refund/reimbursement due to these outages. What it fails to understand is you and if the problem is fixed within an hour the cumulative effect of multiple outages in the space of one year should amount to a refund. Customer service advisors are not able to help with that either. More importantly working from home, these outages account for a significant amount of inconvenience and time wastage. Secondly, I live in a three bedroom house (normal sized) with mostly plaster walls and yet I can’t get Internet signals from the Wi-Fi on the first floor in the bedrooms.

As this had been over 30 minutes, that is not an option and i pointed put under the data protection act i was entitled to a transcript and i wanted to make a complaint.

You then cut off my services 2 days before Christmas and penalised me again with another late payment charge. Your staff seem to be quite helpful but what they say does not seem to be properly actioned and resulting in you repeatedly penalising me financially and by service restriction for actions which are entirely your error.I am not happy with your service in this area, I was a customer of sky for 20 years and never had this problem and they were far more understanding with payment issues.

872,Awful service,"Virgin media service is shocking.   Broadband speeds are often a fraction of the speeds we pay for and connection drops out at random intervals.   The website is almost useless when there are issues and the call centres are similarly frustrating. Long wait times, then scripted responses that reduce their support agents to the level of morons, for example they don't seem to comprehend you are not using wifi if your devices are connected by ethernet cable.  Getting to a point where they will acknowledge the fault is theirs and not yours takes a minimum 3 hours on the phone and multiple phone calls, two visits to the house by service engineers to check we've plugged cables in properly.   They will do anything before giving a begrudging acknowledment that it is their network (which it invariably and obviously is). It is just absolutely awful service.PS. The response below just illustrates the problem.  ""Vast variety of ways to contact us"". The arrogance. The number quoted is their standard number - see above re: long wait times and moronic agents. And the websites just add to the frustration. Our most recent issue on Boxing Day and 27th December when we had a TV and broadband outage for several hours we were promised regular text updates and a call from a manager within 24 hours - neither happened.I looked through other reviews for Virgin Media and they have similar issues, and it started me questioning the 5 star reviews - one of them says ""been with Virgin media for over 34 years now"".  Really? The company has only been around since 2006, and even it's predecessor wasn't around that long. Makes you wonder about the honesty of this company.",Ric,2021,12,23,1,0.107,0.045,Negative

It is now 22nd December 2021 and I have been left without Internet for 2 weeks. I cannot work from home and to be completely honest, I am on the verge of loosing my job due to absences - because I have no Internet access. I have contacted Virgin Media on three separate occasions, asking them to chase up my package as I wasn't getting anywhere myself. They refused to listen to me. On the third attempt I begged them to send me another quickstart package with a different courier. They told me to wait. I was told this issue would be escalated and I would hear back from Virgin Media with an update, this DID NOT happen. I decided to make a formal complaint, to which Virgin Media responded with ""you received your package on the 16th"", blatant lie. Yodels tracking page CLEARLY shows I have not received my package, they still have it. I don't completely blame Virgin Media, I blame their courier. But then I asked myself, if this was my company, and a customer hadn't received their goods that they had paid for, which they desperately needed, would I be to blame? Yes. Because I choose the courier. And, yodel has so many bad reviews, yet they carry on using them. And what about customer service? I have had absolutely no help whatsoever. I have missed out on wages because I've had no Internet access. I just regret the whole thing.

Doesn’t matter what you want to discuss, they’re guaranteed to make it utterly soul destroying. It all seems pretty good, clear button pressing system to get to through to the right team. Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a team- just a heavily manned, noisy call centre-  full of people who have absolutely no idea what it is they’re meant to be doing. 9 times out of 10 you will be placed on hold - then transferred to ‘the correct department’. Excellent. I called to cancel my outrageously overpriced virgin broadband - and after 17 minutes I was successfully transferred to o2 mobile. Admittedly- that’s a brand new level of are they serious - and at least made the experience funny. I hung up - depleted and somewhat tickled - I’ll try again tomorrow. I have not once, in my three years of being with virgin had a straight forward or helpful customer service experience - whether it’s being cut off mid call, transferred multiple times or spending up to 1.5 hours on hold - you can be sure that you query is not a simple one (even if it is) … virgin media customer service makes me wish I had amnesia.**added after the generic response from VM- I thought I’d use the text service as I haven’t tried that ….

I escalated my complaint to CISAS as Virgin continued to charge me despite my services being off for 2 months. How do they get away with this, simple they just lie their way out of everything. They claimed they hadn't provided a poor level of customer service despite me having correspondence that states just that. Stupid as well as liars.Furthermore, it was only until I escalated my complaint to CISAS that they started bombarding me with texts and emails and letters when they ignored and didn't address my correspondence prior to this. They also sent texts about taking the equipment yet they hadn't contacted me or wrote to say I could terminate my contract. I requested to leave them on more than one occasion but they didn't respond. Anyone thinking of going with Virgin need to carefully think about doing this as they may seem fine to begin with, but after what I've experienced with them over the last 2 to nearly 3 months I would strongly advise to stay clear of them. No amount of responses on here to say how sorry they are or 'sorry that their standards have slipped' will cut it.

This colleage could clearly see none of the extensive conversation that was already had and I had to go through security questions again which took over 20 mins. At the end of this I was asked where I would be moving house to. I explained this was not the nature of my query and was subsequently advised it was not possible to add my partner's name to the bill despite their colleage, and website, saying this was possible. they then advised I go through customer service which was again, impossible to get hold of a person, with them trying to divert you to the website at every possible opportunity (of course I had already tried doing this via the website!).

Had they told me before I would have delayed the upgrade!!  Was promised an update for the engineer to visit as a priority but nothing other than a whole load of grief from people who don't listen and don't care.

1025,Poor service,"I can't understand why dealing with internet service providers still feels the same as it did 20 years ago when we had the likes of Telewest and Tiscali. First things first, the router they supply is atrocious. I live in an ex local authority house, and there are rooms upstairs that Wi-Fi just won't reach. We bought TP Link range extenders and that was no help. In the end, we put the Virgin Media paper weight into modem only mode and bought a budget MESH router even that covers more of the house.The speed has never reached the heady heights advertised. Ever. Even after an apparent speed boost, it's all a bit laggy. It's not like we game - maybe a couple of Teams video calls a day but otherwise it's just the 2 of us watching the same TV at night, and it just about copes with they 200 package.It dropped this morning. Did all the usual restarts, etc.  No dice. Tried their WhatsApp chat service, it just kept repeating the same message over and over and over again - we're busy, do you want to hold, 1 for yes, 2 for no - click 2 and then 3 or 4 seconds later it repeats it. No answer on that chat at all. So I ring them. In all fairness the wait time wasn't too bad, but straight through to India. It's 2021, nearly 2022. I understand we are a global village now, but when dealing with potentially complicated support, I want to speak to someone I understand who understands me on a phone line that is clear and with no lag. You simply can't achieve that when you outsource to India. I lost count the number of times I had to ask the woman to repeat herself.After about 10 minutes of ""checking our service status"" she told me the wifi in our house isn't the best, and we should buy Virgin's Intelligent WiFi pods. So it's gone from a support request to her trying to an upsell because their routers aren't good enough to begin with. AMAZING. Obviously, I said no. Then she wanted me to hard reset the modem. I said no - the lights are all on both the modem and the router. The issue isn't inside the house, as I'd already used their own system checked and it confirmed the problem was outside. She insisted. I refused. After a few minutes she agreed to send out an engineer.Earliest available day? Thursday. It's Monday. We're working from home. If I was paying a tenner a month, that would be acceptable.

1032,Joke Of A Company,"So, the last few years we haven't had a problem with Virgin up untill this weekend.We rely on Virgin Broadband for our TV services as we don't have a TV aerial on the roof. We have 2 Autistic Children one of which has PDA, so her demandings are through the roof.Friday 17th December, the Broadband went off, they have identified the problem according to their service checker and a technician is on the way. They have given us a fix estimate about 15 times now and this has yet again now changed to 6pm Sunday 19th December, no doubt it will change again. We are at our whit ends with the kids screaming and to top it off, we have used all our mobile data already which usually lasts a month. You ring them, can't get through to a human at all, there is no Web chat, you try to make a complaint, the complaint form is down due to maintenance on the site. So, we are sat here, no TV, no broadband and kids screaming knowing Virgin have lied saying a technician was on the way, because by now it would of been fixed if they were. They are a complete and utter joke.Update Mon 20th Dec:Still off with the fix estimate changing. So I emailed (apparently) the CEO Lutz Schuler, I'm guessing it goes to customer services though as they escalated as a complaint. They read it very quick as I'm not the account holder but I gave the account holders email to which they replied to very quickly. So, they want up to 28 days to resolve it, if not, it will go to the manager. Why can't it go to a manager straight away due to the situation? 2 Autistic kids facing Christmas with no TV, them kicking off & screaming everyday. I've told them, we need to know if it'll be fixed before Christmas, if not, we'll have to get an aerial on the roof which we'll struggle to pay for. It's a horrible situation they have put us in, it's been hard work with both kids during lockdown and with this happening, it's something we really  don't need.",Gary Sweeney,2021,12,19,1,0.095,0.033,Negative

They are the best advert for Sky. Sky are no angels but they are better than the incompetence I've witnessed over the last 48 hours. Phrases like ""I'm sorry you fell that way"",indicating that I am wrong for expecting services to work. ""I'm sure we won't have cut it off"" whilst I'm logged onto the Hub showing ""Access Denied"". ""Are you sure it's connected?"", whilst I'm logged onto the hub and it shows Virgin are denying access to the service I pay for. It sounds like another organisation that feels entitled and priviliged, littered with staff who are either incompetent or who can only follow a script. If you have hard earned cash and want media services, bypass Virginmedia because when it goes wrong they may eventually fix the issue but ultimately it appears that they don't care and you have to do most of the leg work yourself and you need the patience of a saint. The issue that was the final straw was an upgrade to Hub5, a process that is promised to be frustration free. Their courier of choice, Yodel, was supposed to deliver it on 10 December, shipping notification showed it as out for delivery but someone had to be in to sign for it. To be helpful that someone stayed in all day, rearranging events to ensure that someone was in. No 2 hour window, as promised, no delivery, not even a message to say it's not coming. Web complaint sent to Virgin, still unanswered. Yesterday 17 December, 7 days late, a courier dumped the package on the doorstep, rang the bell and then scarpered.

Virgin in their infinite wisdom decided to cut my Hub 3 off from the internet, expecting me to install the Hub 5 within five hours of receiving it whilst being 15 miles away at work. 2 hours of calling, going through the same shenanigans over and over again, service has finally been restored, thank you Lavanya. Customer relations seem to take the attitude, this is going to be hard and then just cut you off. They record it as a silent call, however we have had a 2 way conversation. They record they got disconnected, as a result of working from home, however I've gone through security and so they do have my Virgin landline and mobile number to call me back. I call it rudeness and lack of professionalism. They NEVER call back. I won't go through the issues over the previous 3 months but it really seems like they like to give people reasons to leave or find out how far they can push people before they walk. I've tried to cancelling twice but Virgin's answer is to cut you off so you cannot complete the termination process.Ultimately if it works, its great, when it goes wrong you are on your own because Virgin really really don't care. It's a shame that they can get one star, the only star I see is the customer for persevering through this rubbish.",Robert,2021,12,18,1,0.106,0.143,Positive
1052,Poor signal,"The member of staff installing my router didn’t assess my house my house properly for the best point so now it doesn’t reach half of the rooms in my house & even drops signal in the kitchen which is only 1 room length away on the groundfloor. When i rang to complain the best the advisor could come up with was for me to buy a booster - another charge per month to get their service to work, unbelievable. I asked to speak to a supervisor who to be fair handled my call very well as i was very irratated. She suggested moving my router to a middle point of the house which shouldn’t be my job but a better solution than the booster.

1054,Not massively impressed- and not good value for money.,"Moved house and Virgin unfortunately have a monopoly on high speed broadband in the area. Other providers can't match the cable speeds offered by Virgin and there is a waiting list for a fibre connection. With working from home a must we could only use Virgin. The service is not cheap and the speeds (when working) are very good and reliable. However the hub provided is atrocious. Signal constantly drops, it randomly restarts and is not reliable at all. I do have my own modem, and will set this up to see if the Wifi signal improves. If you want an out of the box solution from virgin you have to subscribe to a premium package or pay £5/month. I don't have any confidence that paying extra will give a better service though. It is impossible to speak to anyone - and their support is all online - which is great (if you have an internet connection).I was with Plusnet in the past and if they could have supplied a fibre connection at half the speed here I would much rather have stuck with them.",Saif Salih,2021,12,17,2,0.045,0.102,Positive

I measured my download speed in 6 different sources and all of them didn't display more than 1.2 Mbps, with the lowest being 0.55 Mbps.

Awful experience.Of course it's important to mention absolutely zero level of customer service, it takes about 1 hour to reach them via phone, since website is completely useless with regular broken links and 404 errors. Be careful when buying something from them.

I was assured that if we stayed with Virgin in the new property we would simply start a new contract period. If Virgin couldn't supply the new property then we would be free without penalty. Eventually we moved and were shocked to find Virgin couldn't provide the new property - we had only moved a couple of miles. We were even more shocked when they made us pay a hefty early termination fee, in spite of the terms on which I had accepted the new deal. This is to say nothing of the fact that the WiFi kept cutting off regularly. At one point it would happen two or three times a day, usually in work zoom sessions.

1087,Truly abysmal customer service.,"I left Virgin as a broadband provider after a couple of years over a decade ago because their customer service was so abysmal I just couldn't take it anymore.Recently, due to a technical issue with the BT landline that could not be resolved by TalkTalk, (whose customer service was excellent), I was forced to go back to Virgin as the only alternative.I have landline and broadband with them and after a few months of bills, wanted to review my package to see if it would make sense to swap to 'Evening and Weekend' calls, instead of just weekend calls included. My first issue is their 'myvirginmedia' website.  It is terrible.  Information is actually hard to find and it solely focuses on selling you the most expensive packages.  Worse than this, it has broken link '404' errors everywhere, as well 'oh dear we can't find that page' errors.  The fact that a communication service provider's website would be so awful is just shameful really.As I could not find the information I wanted (very straightforward - how much would it cost to add Evening calls to my package) I opted to use the 'Live Chat'.  I was triaged by a bot asking irrelevant questions for what I wanted; then after waiting 10 minutes I was told the wait to speak to an agent would be at least over 15 minutes - so no actual 'Live Chat'.  But not to worry, they had found some links to help me with my query -  but they were also all broken.So I put in a complaint through their website, explaining the issues and what I wanted.I got a swift response  - basically telling me I should log into myvirginmedia and check.  Never mind I had already told them I had been there and that was half the issue.So I responded, suggesting perhaps they should actually read my message and give me the information I wanted.I got a second response a day later, telling me that to add evening calls to my package would take my monthly cost from £27 to £50 per month, because to do so I would have to lose the 'discounted' new customer contract.If you check their 'Call Charges' document, the difference between Weekend only and Evening and Weekend is about £4, but strangely, Evening and Weekend is listed as not available to new customers.So its a service I could not have as a new customer and to have it as an existing customer will break my contract and cost considerably more than £4.Its hugely disappointing to learn that in the intervening years since I was last their customer they really havn't improved at all in that regard - and their rating on here attests to that.

1091,Where do I start,"Where do I start? I’ve never ever had to deal with a company that needs completely rebooting.Their policies are out of date and not fit for purpose.Their agents don’t seem to be allowed to use common sense to resolve minor issues before, like mine did, they become one that ends up shining a light in the dark corners where the leadership team is failing both their customers and their people. I sense that middle management have no faith in their front liners.There’s zero trust given to the agents who’ve passed training. In big companies staff need to know the rules so that they have a framework to work within but rules HAVE to be flexible at times. if staff are not trusted to make a reasonable adjustment to a rule, the laws of unintended consequences will bite you on the backside leaving a big problem for someone to else to resolve. Now if the front line agent had been able to apply some flexibility, what a different outcome! This is my example. Judge me honestly! By the time this incident occurred, I was starting my 11th hour in direct contact with virgin to try and resolve 3 issues. One was pretty serious. I care for a family of two, both have serious cognitive disabilities. The son needs more careful consideration. Changes in routine, strangers at the door, not understanding why things happen, they can all cause him great distress. And we all are always mindful to protect his serenity, mostly because he’s one of life’s beautiful souls. And I won’t sugar coat it, if anything starts to trigger the beginning of a crisis, there’s no, ‘I’ll deal with it later’, no, it’s dealt NOW and it’s dealt with 100% of my attention and focus. At the moment it’s me and his Mum as support. His mum, she’s affected, she’s utterly bonkers, but thank god for her in my life. She is no fool but I started helping her work out why her services were sending her demands for payments, I realised she’s incredibly vulnerable and hasn’t been able to manage her money very well, partly because she can’t use the phone because of her hearing but also because she’s so trusting. She also very often can’t provide what is asked of her. Anyways, she’s amazing, she’s been on her own with no help, looking after her son who is has serious cognitive disabilities for nearly 50 years without asking a single person for help. I’ve known her for 18 years now. We met waking our dogs. Mine was with me from Battersea Dogs Home, sent to me to recover from an operation. Apparently they heal quicker and with less stress in a home. Anyway, that’s how we met, I wanted to keep the dog but couldn’t leave him home alone, she was retired, she said she would, boom, we bonded.So the wifi goes down in her home. I call virgin. I explain how important it is to get the tv working. Her son has been without tv for 2 hours. Now that there’s nothing for him to do because of service cuts, his tv is his care in the community. And he’s already at 100. His mum is deaf so I’m having to shout full volume to try and explain to her that I can’t fix it this time, that I need to call virgin. I try to ask her for what I think virgin might need. She doesn’t have a clue where to get the account number. She doesn’t have a number. This is my cold case day one, hour one. As I’m googling for virgins number, her son is following me as I pace. Tugging at my arm, ‘my tv won’t work,’ ‘I know love, I’m going to phone them in a minute.’ Immediately another tug ‘my tv won’t work,’ and in that 15 minutes before I made that first call to Virgin, the madness was in full flow and I needed help. The calls to virgin weren’t good. Everything they said to me, I shouted it to my Girl. Her boy is shouting too. By now he’s rocking, banging his hand to his head, getting up to tug my arm ‘why is my tv not working?’ The noise was deafening. Im relaying what virgin want, it’s clearly her that’s the account holder. It’s clear that this is a very distressing situation. But because she couldn’t remember her password, they wouldn’t help us. Then I tried WhatsApp. It took me 45 mins to get everything that virgin wanted for us to pass security. I was told I had failed. Without knowing why. They asked for her name. Her post code. The account number. The date her direct debit left. The amount of the direct debit. And the amount of her last bill. It took me over 2 hours to find this stuff. And they wouldn’t help. Because ONE letter of her name didn’t match their system. No one used their common sense and helped me. For 3 days we lived in a madhouse. He was raging by now, smashing things up, she was attacking him, I was trying to reassure, then I was seen as the cause. It was HELL. But worse still, the boy had an crisis, a really bad one. Their dedicated accessibility number spent 4 hours asking me again and again if I would wait. The WhatsApp was horrendous. Eventually a lovely guy on Twitter helped us.

1105,Very poor customer service overrides what could be a great company,"I signed up to the 200Mb broadband package when I moved into a new flat, as it was already installed there and I thought would be easiest to just use the same provider.I had nothing but issues for about 6 weeks - both in terms of the broadband speed, wifi reception, unhelpful customer support.The positives:+ Broadband for the past week has been fairly consistent (not 100%) but acceptableThe negatives:- Having about 8 technicians having to come out and try to fix the issues- One technician said he needed to go out and have a look at the cabling. I never saw him again. According to customer support he needed to go back to the depot, but he never came back- Telephone support is always available, you never have to wait long to speak to them, but it's a real lottery if you get someone who is just a bit unhelpful or utterly useless. One guy I'm sure was on his PS4 and was annoyed at having to speak to me.On me telling one agent that the hub keeps needing to be reset, and asking if it needs replacing, she insisted it was fine and its absolutely normal to have to switch it on and off regularly and wait 20 minutes for it to start up. The technician who arrived a couple of days later said the hub seems faulty and needed replacing and it's been fine since then.- Several times after a technician had been round the 200Mb was achieved for about 2 days and then went back to being slow, which is very suspicious to say the least- On originally going to pick up the hub at the click & collect shop I'd agreed, I turned up and was told they don't do click & collect. After calling customer support they said actually it hasn't even been sent out and a technician needs to come round in a few weeks time. This was when I first moved in so I was supposed to be without broadband for weeks.- If you cancel before 18 months you have to pay an £80 cancellation fee. I may still have to cancel as I'm not convinced the service will remain as good as it has been the last week or so.I could go on and on but can't really be bothered. It's a shame us this could and should be a fantastic company, and if this current service was in operation when I first moved in (and didn't slow down) it would be a 4 or 5* review.",Mike,2021,12,16,2,0.063,0.077,Positive
1106,Don’t waste your money on this scam of a “service”,Virgin has been the worst experience I have ever had with any internet provider. At least every 4 months we lose our internet for about  3 weeks but this time round it just got so bad when an engineer cancelled on us and so they made us wait a month for the next one without notifying us of this change. I only found out when I called to inquire why an engineer didn’t come that day to which they replied that he had cancelled and the next one was booked in a months time. They provided no alternatives in the meantime and gave no compensation or refunds even when we threatened to take this to the ombudsman. We are paying for a service but not receiving that service. And the worst part is they don’t give any refunds or compensations for when they have lacked in providing us the service that we pay money for.

After finally getting through to a human, (their Ai automated service cannot comprehend anything but a basic question) all he was interested in was to try and sell her a new policy for an extra four pounds per month as he said this was the only way to get the booster, even though now that virgin and o2 customer are entitled to the booster for free, and a free upgrade to the next data level, he tried to give the impression he was doing her a favour. She had to read back their own adverts to make him aware of this. The customer service seems to be geared up to squeezing out extra fees when not needed. Overall Virgin just remember you have customers who can just walk away to another provider. You need to up your game in customer service and listen more to their complaints.

The gentleman told me the costs and gave me the total costs and said to progress he would need to do a credit check, no problem there pretty standard checks. But apparently not with Virgin Media who ended up doing 3 hard searches on my credit file but it hasn't ended there. I now have 3 accounts added to my credit each with a ""Credit Limit"". At no time did the gentleman say that signing up would result in any addition to my credit file beyond a credit search. At no time was I told about credit agreements, cooling off periods etc. I contacted customer services today who pretty much dismissed my complaint that I had been sold a ""Credit Agreement"" let alone 3 credit agreements. He dismissed any concerns about how the addition of 3 credit accounts in quick succession would have on my credit score. Totally indifferent to my concern that this had been mis-sold.I have tried to contact their complaints department but there is a charge of £3.60 per minute.I would caution anyone thinking about joining in over 25 years of being a Sky customer and 15 years with BT I have NEVER had a Credit Account placed on my credit file.

1161,What a terrible service you have. Appalling.,"After a very troublesome installation process that took weeks and numerous phone calls to different outsourced call centres in various countries. My wife and I amassed over 10 hours chasing you guys on our mobile phones. You probably have one of the worse customer services that I have ever experienced in my nearly 50 years on this planet. I have been with Virgin media for so many years and you completely let me down on a simple house move. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were simply either hung up on, sent to another call center to start the process all again with no recorded or marked data from the last call. We had promises made, dates not kept to and most importantly my business suffered. I had no internet for weeks to run by business affairs and my family suffered with no TV or entertainment. So thanks Virgin for being utterly rubbish and causing so much unnecessary emotional pain. Your service is terrible and your customer service even worse.",Andrew,2021,12,14,1,0.151,0.068,Negative

1164,"Good internet speeds, but moving is a nightmare, and they are careless with personal data","Due to the complaint I sent directly to Virgin Media not receiving an adequate response, I am going to re-write my review here to better reflect my experience with them.Originally, I had Virgin Media services at my old flat which I was quite happy with. I was receiving high speeds of ~350 Mbps and a mostly reliable connection. I had no complaints about their service in this old flat.However, the nightmare started when I moved house. I notified Virgin Media well in advance of moving house and picked out a new contract to go with it as well. I arranged for engineers to come on the day I was moving into my new house. When they came, they said the installation could not proceed as the external works were not done and said I would be called to arrange a new date for the installation. They also told me that the address Virgin Media had on record for me - and this is the crux of my complaint. I phoned up their customer service support line and live chatted several times to try and get them to change the address to the correct one, and each time they reassured me that it had been changed (when it hadn't - if it had, I wouldn't have had to call them so many times).On the second engineer visit - which I had to arrange myself as I did not receive any calls from Virgin - I was once again told that the address they had on record was wrong and once again, the external works hadn't been done! Yet again, I had to call Virgin to try and get them to change the address they had on record. Then it turned out that my address wasn't a serviceable address at all, and that I had to register my interest instead!But that isn't even all. One day I tried to call them and suddenly found myself unable to pass the security checks for the exact same account number I had used to call them previously, which I had been able to pass before. It turns out that they had changed the details on the account to those of the neighbour who actually lived at the address I had tried to get removed from my personal record. Being a technology company, I would have thought that they would realise that this is a terrible idea and that instead, they would create a whole new account for them with a brand new account number. Then again, what should I expect, given that this is the same company that said it's secure to have your password sent to you via letter because it's illegal to open someone else's mail!The cherry on top is that they had then proceeded to send me this other person's name, sort code and half of their bank account number to my e-mail! Of course, upon receiving this e-mail, I immediately rang Virgin to notify them of this, and I also notified my neighbour of this flagrant data breach too. Virgin told me that the account would be cancelled and they would notify the neighbour as well.This was what prompted me to write an extensive letter complaint detailing my experience with Virgin. The response to my extensive complaint was a generic paragraph that did not address any of my concerns at all. It did not address the failure to update my address. It did not address the multiple times engineers came and did not install services. It did not even address the breach of GDPR and how they irresponsibly leaked someone else's personal details to me! I was essentially just told, ""thank you for your feedback, the account has been disconnected and there is no outstanding balance."" Oh, and the response was sent to my old address (despite me specifying my new address in the letter itself) - thank God for Royal Mail's redirection service!I hope my review here will at least get a better response than the canned, careless response I received to my complaint letter, and that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale for anyone considering moving house with Virgin Media. If there is one redeeming factor, it is that the customer service team are generally patient, but this does not make up for what I went through with them.Dear Kath:Thank you, but no thank you. I am not going through the phone maze with countless security checks again for the umpteenth time.Nor am I going to text - the last time I did that, I was gaslit by the agent who kept telling me he was not receiving the screenshot of the contract I was given, or the e-mail that came with this contract - that I sent via text several times - and ignoring the contract number when I gave it to him.The other contact methods are unavailable to me because my account has been disconnected. Either that or they are essentially ignored, as my detailed complaint letter has been.I have already called Virgin Media about this inadequate response and was provided with a second complaint reference, however this has not been followed up at all. And now they have the nerve to ask for their equipment back! They probably won't even find my new house given all my troubles with trying to correct the new address.",Matt,2021,12,14,1,0.055,0.048,Negative

My experience is that VM staff have no intention of owning the problem or resolving the matter. I have asked for my complaint to be reviewed in accordance with VM Complaint Procedures. It has not happened. I have asked for the contact details of the Compliance Office, as I think there is a data protection issue, but that is not forthcoming. I have emailed the CEO to ask him to review the matter, but no acknowledgement, let alone a full response. The service is poor and clearly not designed to be helpful.

No one comes back with satisfactory answers, and we've had 3 missed appointments which come and go just to call up and have them tell us that it's been rescheduled for another 10 days time. The right people are not getting in touch or have been coming to see what the problem is- which is why we have the missed appointments. It is laughable, and each time I talk to someone they say ""rest assured someone will be there"". At this point it is the customer service who cried wolf. I have no faith in them.

Some websites call it not fit for purpose due to a design flaw. In my experience it means under heavy load (gaming, streaming etc) the internet just stalls, often with WiFi cutting out for a few minutes at a time (although wired internet remains). For this reason I've bought my own router and put the Hub 3 into modem mode, so far the issues seem to be alleviated.It's also worth mentioning when I lived in Stranmillus it seems the network there was oversubscribed. Very often the fibre itself would drop out for an evening, usually on Thursdays. I've not hit this issue in Windsor.Nevertheless, Virgin Media offer a good flexible contract for students, something competitors don't seem to do.

They explicitly agree on the phone one price for a package and then when you get your bill, they decide to overcharge you. Connection charges were waived off however when I got confirmation of the changes by email it appeared that it wasn't waived off. The technical team are very diabolical as well. They made me jump many technical hoops 2 or 3 times of remving the connections from the back of the router, switching it off, connecting everything back and then restarting the router however that does not seem to work. Eventually yesterday a technical engineer came out to solve the issue and despite that we were not able to get the speed that we were promised. I then rang Virgin Media to downgrade my package back to the 350 MB per second that I was getting previously however they cheekily decided to remove some of my package which they had previously agreed to keeping. They also had the gall to charge a connection charge when it was explicitly told to me that I would not be having any charges. I will be sure to terminate all of my services with Virgin Media as the way I have been treated has been utterly diabolical.EDIT AFTER VIRGIN 1ST REPLY: In response to your reply of yesterday, DO I LOOK AS IF I HAVE GOT A SIGN ON MY FOREHEAD THAT SAYS STUPID?!

1273,Impossible to get hold of them and when you do they are useless,"Virgin have become impossible to get hold of. They have made it really difficult for customers to get in touch either by phone or online. Have to google their phone number because it's nowhere on their own site. Having tried to get through to them several times in the last few months I've come to the conclusion they don't want to hear from customers - they want your money and that's it! I've had lots of broadband issues and the online guides are absolutely S**T. Calling their tech support number gets you an automated service that goes through the same advice as online and then hangs up on you. When I did finally get through to a human they were marginally more helpful and got me up and running but it took ages and I had to wait 45mins after the call before I would know if it worked - so had to take it on faith this person knew what they were doing - not a great ask when your service has been so poor beforehand. Today I've been trying to find out some information about their new hub 5 and even that is impossible, their contact us page is down and only gives error 404, but here is a guide to upgrade! Oh what's that? They want you to spend more instead of getting the help you want. Absolute joke. Shame as virgin used to be fairly decent, these days their ONLY selling point is their broadband speed, as soon as I can get these speeds from a different company believe me I will. And for any potential customers reading - if you only need the usual 76mbs that other providers offer then I would strongly suggest going with one of them!",Katy Rossiter,2021,12,12,1,0.083,0.061,Negative

Completely missold the product. Can never get through to anyone helpful, everyone you speak to has zero training, very difficult to get them to understand the problem, get passed round multiple people because no one can take responsibility.

Tried contacting Virgin Media to sort this issue and it took me a month to get an engineer out just so he can tell me the issue is with the smart WiFi which is a feature to split your 2.4 and 5GHz bands which has nothing to do with the performance of my internet.

1318,Dishonest and incompetent,"Virgin Media are without doubt the most untruthful and borderline incompetent company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I requested a service move to a house that I had just completed on in early October. I was assured that the move would be seamless (we had 3-4 weeks) and my package would be reduced from £65pm to £52pm (the package in my new home was initally £76pm - I have no idea why) because the person on the phone was ""a nice guy"". I called about 10 days before the move and was told that because the person who I bought the house from wanted to keep their number, it would be a bit more complicated. I called every few days and the message was the same - they were negotiating a move with the previous owner (who hadn't lived in the house for 6 months). I was due to move house on 30th Oct and was told that I would not be installed until 10th November. I researched a move to Sky, who could install on 4th Nov, and (surprise, surprise) Virgin Media could actually install on 3rd Nov. At this point, on 27th Oct, I requested that a complaint be submitted and spent 20mins on the phone completing the complaint which I only learnt yesterday was never submitted and there is no record of it ever being discussed. In early November, I received a letter informing my that my package had been set at £76pm. I called to ask why this was the case when I had been promised a package for £52pm. I was told to wait for the next bill and that a manager had approved £52pm, with a rolling credit applied, that would be applied if my first bill wasn't accurate. I checked my latest bill yesterday and (surprise, surprise) I'm being charged £76pm. I called yesterday and was informed that there is no record of £52pm every being discussed or agreed.I'm summary, Virgin Media are dishonest:1) pretending to submit a complaint which wasn't, 2) committing to a lower fee without any record of it - I'm sure they could check recordings if they bothered3) committing to calling me back and never doing soand incompetent:1) taking over 4 weeks to process a straightforward move to a property which I had already purchased and leaving me without internet for almost a week.I have (2nd time lucky) submitted another complaint and they said a manager would call me within 24 hours to discuss my complaint.

I have raised a complaint for the same issue 6 times in the last 12 month and requested written instructions on what browser security settings I should employ to allow me to use their TV streaming service - I'm still waiting. The security verification process appears very fragmented - I have provided the same details on multiple occasions; sometimes the answers are accepted, sometimes they are not. And they won't allow you to escalate to a manager to discuss with them. The contract cancellation period is exactly 30 days.

1353,Mis-sold Wifi- & TV bundle deal by Virgin Media,"In early October 2021, Virgin Media mis-sold to me a Wifi-& TV-deal over the phone, on the express understanding that it would include Netflix and Amazon Prime in the bundle. I said that I only wanted these two aforementioned additional channels in their TV offering, as opposed to any other movie- or sports- channels. I was told that my preferred choices would be included in a  ‘special, discounted offer’ deal of £38.99 p/m. Allegedly, this ‘special offer’ wouid expire on 10th October 2021. The Virgin Media sales rep’s name is Mr Tony Nicholls, who was allegedly based in Wigan. He explained that there were two options available: 1), Freeview, (basic package) at £33.33 p/m or 2), Netflix and Prime included, at £38.99 p/m. I then called back Virgin Media, to set up an account with them, for the £38.99 deal. This time, I was connected to Mr Markus Tommasi on the phone. Though I was four days late, he said he nevertheless had the power/authority  to set up my account on the £38.99-deal as initially offered to me by his colleague Mr Nichols and so he consequently processed my initial payment on this understanding. When I later realised that Netflix was in fact not available on my newly purchased Virgin bundle, without my separately registering with Netflix at an additional £13.99 p/m, I called Virgin’s helpline number on 24th November 2021, to enquire about this. I ended up in a long and pleasant conversation with a call handler in India by the name of Thanistha. Her ID no. was allegedly #68335. She apologised for the disappointing experience I have had and she assured me she would get the the matter looked into and that she would arrange that Virgin revert to me by Friday, 26th November 2021, and in any event, no later than the following week. It is now 15 days later, and I have had no return call, nor any written explanation from Virgin Media. The level of service received to date is unacceptable. Unless I hear back from Virgin Media within the next 72 hours, I shall strongly recommend to others that they might be better-advised to consider any other Wifi-and TV bundle service providers on the market instead. Moreover, unless Virgin Media addresses the issue raised and rectifies the problem, I will not hesitate to report Virgin Media to the Financial Ombudsman Service, for having mis-sold me a Wifi & TV bundle, which is in breach of the Supply of Goods and Services Act, because it does not deliver the content of what I was promised.",Dissatisfied Customer,2021,12,9,1,0.036,0.05,Positive

I only use 1 console device that is connected to my router. And when you ring up. They offer you an upgrade at a slightly higher cost then what your paying currently. ( like I said quick at taking money but slow at solving issues).I've noted tho in the 5-6 years when the weather is extreme or it rains all day that the problems accure more frequently then usual. Which confuses me considering all there wires and cable is feed underground. I'd understand if it was cables going across poles.

The time before that, I was transferred to different team members and was on the chat for 5.5 hours going round in circles. No compensation offered and when they finally fixed my bill they told me they had ‘waived the fees’ like I should be grateful? The fees were put on my bill incorrectly in the first place! They keep telling me that they have fixed my bill indefinitely but as each month comes, the *incorrect* additional fees are re-added so I have to start the process again and spend hours on hold.

When I messaged to see whether they had returned, I found out the chat had been disconnected and therefore my issue did not get resolved after 4 hours of messaging.

I now have a new hub which gives me 550mbps at the hub but drops to 300mbps in 20ft. The engineer could not explain why and I am left using 4g on my phone rather than use the broadband. To add insult to injury in October I was unable to access my email account. On phoning I was told the account was locked. It would appear the email advising me was sent after they locked the account. Very clever. Having run virus software and changed my password the account was opened. A month later again without warning it was locked again. Again after further long phone calls and another password change the account was unlocked. Surprise Surprise today they locked it yet again. Yet more calls another password change and more time wasted. I can accept my account being compromised on the first occasion but I used such complicated passwords on the the two changes it would be impossible for someone to compromise them within a month. I therefore believe someone at VM security is locking my account without checking to see if the account had been updated.

Booked a installation date and the engineer came and he was here for a while (max 2-3 hours) so I borrowed him my parking permit. The engineer left with my parking permit and blocked my number! I had to call him repeatedly on private number, he finally picked up and rudely told me that he will not bring my permit back because it’s a inconvenience for him to drive back. I politely asked him to do a recorded delivery and he agreed but I still have not received my permit after 8 days! I have to walk 5 minutes everyday in cold December to my car which is so annoying.This is when it gets worse I Called virgin to report the issue and they blatantly told me that they do not have the information of the engineer they instructed as he is not with virgin and is a third party company! I asked for a phone call back from a manager as I was mortified that they would send someone to my house and not have any details or the company? not even the name of the company? I asked to cancel my agreement with immediate effect!  A whole week went past and no phone call or any update in regards to my parking permit. However I was being bombarded with texted about broadband installation, bare in mind. I requested to cancel my agreement due to the lack of customers service and not feeling comfortable with the fact that they simply send any cowboys to your house. The customer service completely ignored me and the attitude changed from when I wanted to sign up until I wanted my permit back. Literally good to disgusting service! I called 20 times plus!  no update, no feedback and they can’t speak English? Recent update, finally spoke to a gentleman that speaks fluent English and he said he will get a manager to call me or get the permit back. I’m not going to hold my breath but I’m hoping I can finally get it back. Now I’m left with no broadband no data in my house because I stupidly thought virgin was going to be good and all the other providers are advising I have to wait for 2 weeks! THANKS VIRGIN!

1380,Don’t even consider going with Virgin Media,"I can’t put into words how bad their customer service and WiFi is, but I’ll describe to the best of my ability: 1) the CUSTOMER SERVICE  is EMBARRASSINGLY AWFUL, you must repeat everything and explain yourself repeatedly but when they misunderstand they talk to you as if you have not two brain cells to rub together. So condescending. 2) THEY DO NOT CARE HOW THEY ARE TREATING YOU, I’ve been surprisingly charged for something from months ago, and have now had my wifi cut off and been told I must pay 3 months worth today or I won’t get my wifi back. And when I explained I can’t pay this and in December of all months I was met with a complete lack of care. 3) THE COMPLAINTS PROCESS IS NONEXISTENT, several times I’ve made complaints, you get no resolution, you don’t hear back, I have a pending investigation into my surprise charge, they’ve cut my wifi off and have opened another investigation into the first investigation. So two ongoing investigations over the same issue, because there’s never a resolution, they want your money- they don’t care about anything else. 5) THE WIFI IS BAD, the WiFi is rubbish anyways, I’m constantly putting my data on because the WiFi is slow and struggles to reach the other end of studio flat. A studio flat. 6) THE SCAM OF A LEAVE THE CONTRACT FEE, specially left of my contract is 8 months and 24 days, due to the shambles which is this company’s entire format I want to leave, which would cost me £140 approximately. To pay for the rest of my contract each month and stay with them £199.92. £50 difference. So they’ve made the leave your contract fee so high that there’s no point, you might as well stay trapped because long term it’s going to cost pretty much the same amount. So, once you enter into that contract- even with everything I’ve mentioned- financially you’re probably going to have to stay with them. And you know that’s on purpose. So to conclude: AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Honestly I’ve been with them half of my contract so far and I can guarantee you the day it runs out I’ll be cancelling and never coming back to virgin media. Safe yourself the aggravation and go with someone else. Unlike other companies, THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THEY DO NOT CARE TO PRETEND TO HAVE A DECENT CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM.",M.

I’ll give you an abridged version:1) I didn’t have internet for a month when I moved into my new flat.

And was never called back when they said they would call with more information.2) They charged me for the month even though I’d been told by multiple people they would NOT charge me and in fact they promised I’d receive some extra compensation for the horrible experience. When I called to enquire why I’d been charged they told me it wasn’t a service affecting issue… not sure how me not having internet for a month because a cable was broken at street level constitutes as my service not being affecting?3) during the process of trying to get my money back for a month where they didn’t provide me the service I was charged for, I requested, as is within my right, a copy of my records. I was promised these records AS WELL AS a call from a manger to sort out the payment issue, and with no great surprise I’ve not received my records nor the promised call.It has been an experience filled with inexcusable incompetence and unlawful actions from Virgin Media.

Basically saying to me that if I increase my monthly bill by £5 a month I can have faster broadband and it will be fixed for 18 months because my deal is running out next month and it will increase by £34. This was complete fabrication as my deal runs to June 2022 and in my opinion was designed to try and panic me into agreeing the price increase. Been with Virgin for years but will definitely leave next June because of this.

They lie and make it up!Made complaint, do not telephone or on line chat, cut you off. Sent complaint recorded delivery. Complaint resolution with no resolution !!!! Telephoned to disconnect, no mention of exit charge of £240.00!! They charge you for a month in advance, despite being disconnected. Then levy a exit charge.Good riddance VM, truly you are a shoddy, dishonest and bullying organisation. At least you are good at obtaining a consistent 90 per cent poor rating.Total disregard for the very customers that stay loyal. Business model of enticing you with discounts, (which you pay back over the 18 months with annual price increases and a hefty exit fee of £240.00) STAY AWAY at all costs.Update 15/12- Made another complaint seeking explanation of final bill, billed one month in advance and £240.00. I do not see the point of paying a month over my disconnection date, knowing full well I will never get the refund back by cheque!!!Perhaps Kath, from VM you can sort this out for me as making another complaint by recorded delivery just gets the same response from the first complaint.

1526,Bad Customer Service,"I am very disappointed and appalled by Virgin Media! We got everything set up ready to install broadband into our first home (we set this up around 2 weeks ago). My other half has been on a 12 hour night shift and slept on the sofa downstairs to ensure he didn't miss the engineer coming out to install our broadband. However he gets a phone call instead saying they cannot come out because it would be too difficult to fit broadband in our home. After being told originally it won't be a problem. They literally said to my other half they are not coming as it is too much work basically and they will not be attending. My boyfriend asked what is the next step and they suggested finding broadband elsewhere! They haven't even visited the house! No apology for inconvenience caused at all! I called to try and shed some light and also put in an official complaint, I got informed the reason they cannot come out today is because they need an alternative engineer to do this job as the other engineer can't. I questioned this as we was told completely different story and the response was miss-communication. I tried to explain in-between shifts and taking annual leave they must appreciate this can't happen again, so I asked when the other engineer is to be scheduled. She could not confirm this and wanted to give me a different number to call. So I asked if they could ring my other half again (like at 9am this morning) to arrange another date. This was not possible, so I questioned this. Got told she cannot get someone to call and hung up. No warning of terminating the call. The customer service on the phone was terrible, they clearly just couldn't be bothered and after fobbing us off for the installment, I then got fobbed off on the phone. I'm absolutely astonished at this level of service, its absolutely shocking. I'm a manager myself and I feel as though there need to be some more training in customer service, as it was so poor. I still can't put my complaint in, due to bad customer service and fobbing me off basically. Very unhappy! Especially when we were so highly recommended.

We were a VM customer for broadband, TV and phone for a number of years - and something has clearly started to go wrong recently in the whole organisation - they need a root and branch overhaul. Woeful broadband (North London N22) - yes it's fast but totally unfit / unreliable for home working. Even worse customer service (when I asked an Engineer outside my house about why the broadband was down (yet again) he told me to ""look at the ticket"" whatever that was supposed to mean). Apart from that unhelpful encounter the only other time I actually spoke to a real human being was when I was going through the cancellation process in my rush to leave them! Otherwise it was support by twitter (useles) or robot text (even worse). Hopefully by now you may have guessed that I am not their biggest fan and that I whole heartedly do not recommend them. I am on the other side now (Openreach based) and will post a review on the other provider in a few months time (so far so good - with fingers crossed)",David C,2021,12,4,1,0.095,0.086,Negative

Calling them to syphon any information from anyone is nightmare inducing. You will be passed around to at least 4 people to then be just hung up on or have the call disconnect.

After being told i wouldnt be charged when the bill came in, i  was, twice. it then happened again the following month after being promised to it would never happen again. my scepticism and cynicism is at an all time as  a result of the cataclysmically bad company.

Speed was always as promised (350Mbs) but very marginally (I mean marginally) lower at the very highest peak of demand.We are completely satisfied. All has been working perfectly.Just a suggestion if I may: many people nowadays use their own routers (i have done so for many years). The reason is that the router side provided by ISPs are generally inadequate. Sadly, Virgin is no exception. Could please Virgin supply on customer's request a modem only box, please?

When I rang on Wed and Fri just talked through rebooting set top box which didn't fix the problem. Eventually they decided to send me a new set top box  which I was told would arrive Sun (stayed in all day but no delivery). Mon rang them to be told no box had been sent so would get one in next 2 days - they then sent me 3 new boxes. After installing new box rang to get it activated and asked for other boxes to be picked up - not done. Sent complaint via email a week later asking for boxes to be picked up - (no response a week later despite complaint showing as active on website). Rang again on 3rd Dec and was told they had been picked up on 18th Nov so I explained they hadn't - have now been told they will be picked up in next 5 days - they couldn't give me a date or time but would ring when they were coming - am I expected to stay in just in case they turn up? which based on their inefficiency so far may or may not happen.

I managed to cancel my services with Virgin on day 12 within my 14 cooling off period. Engineer done install and all was good. After he left and devices were connected the problems started. I have on average 20 devices connected to the hub 3 and it seems it can’t handle that many (which isn’t a lot in todays digitally connected world). My wife & daughter work from home and were both constantly getting kicked off the Wi-Fi when in the room next door to the router. My daughter even moved into the same room as the router and still got kicked off 3 times. When I called to cancel I was told to increase my speed and that would help. (My old broadband provider was less than half Virgin’s speed and never had drop offs). I was then offered free smart pods which would boost the range but I wasn’t keen as the Wi-Fi has been terrible from day 1 and if I tried them I’d be over the 14 days cooling off and I didn’t want any hassles cancelling at a later date with possible high cancellation fees. Virgin sort out your router issues and things could be so much better.

The month before, the broadband speed was a quarter of what it was supposed to be. I think the company is on its way out.Reply to Tom - I'm sorry, Tom, I've wasted hours talking to your people on the phone, with no real results.

The equipment is unreliable, no TV channels all day today is small fry compared to the long running issues I and by the other reviewers comments, many others suffer with this company. My WiFi has a mind of its own, it works some of the time and drops frequently. Even when it works it seems temperamental, I will have strong WiFi in the room with the router but move anywhere else in the house and it drops to a point where we struggle to have two phones getting used at the same time on WiFi. I was told this is as expected. The second box can normally handle live TV but recordings are pretty useless. When I try to watch recordings on this box it constantly stutters, buffers and if I dare to start watching a programme before the recording has finished it will stop recording it when I start watching or at least miss a section out. I could start watching a football match and get to maybe 60 minutes in, then all of a sudden it flicks to the studio discussion after the match having stopped recording for a ten, twenty maybe thirty minute period, hopeless. This is in a second box which plays the recordings using WiFi but you still need an actual cable up the side of your house to receive live TV on that box!!! Who came up with that, the additional boxes are wireless, but not really wireless! I gave up with customer services long ago, I honestly have never dealt with a more unhelpful department, they solved nothing during my many, many, many calls. The only time I saw an engineer was when I posted my scathing review of their practices on the virgin media forums. Like a number on this site, I am waiting for the minimum tie in period to end so I can get rid of them once and for all.

I also cannot use mains cabling boosters due to ring main separation (and that only enables wired connectivity) This is the 21st Century any service provider worth their salt would be able to give halfway decent WiFi this seemingly is beyond Virgin So either I put up with zero connectivity upstairs or I PAY Virgin for their mesh system (only works for Virgin) or spend more money buying a WiFi booster such as a TP Link unitI live in a 1950s semi not on a massive mansion As far as I am concerned the package is not fit for purpose Playing the emotional card I’m a pensioner!!!I had over a decade of perfect WiFi service for the whole house from BT whole house, not just where you could see the router…  this is a massive retrograde stepI keep getting asked to recommend Virgin I cannot and will not as I value friendship too much.

I told the engineer when I was away with work virgin media come to the house and moved the where the router connection from downstairs hallway to someone’s bedroom who’s health is really and and I told them I need it moved back to where it was supposed to be and under no circumstances I can’t have my landline In there, but the engineer said to set up my landline and just turn the main phone off that comes from the room and the rest cordless phone will work so the person wouldn’t be disturbed if the landline was called in the room, however that did not work, the box the phone charges on and to check voicemails would still go off whenever someone called even though I turned the volume of the actual handset, and the engineer told me if this Didn’t work that he will leave a not on the system and they will send someone out to move the router back to where it previously was and it wouldn’t cost me anything, I finally got through to them for them to tell me i will have to pay Now  for moving the router back from where they shouldn’t have put it in the first place for £35, I asked to speak to the manager and maybe they will resolve the issue however to my disgust the manager asked for £125 instead of the original £35 the previous employee said even though I was told I wouldn’t pay for it, the manager eventually told me someone will call in a week and get it sorted for free, just as I expected nobody called me, and the whole time I had all the landline turned off from the connection and I’ve had to pay £15 a month for calls that I can’t make and to rub it in my face I can’t go on my account and take the call plan off my package but I can add it on, then to add to the frustration they don’t take money out of my direct debit and send me an email for late payment and a  payment fee, for the last 3 months I’ve not been able to set up a direct befit up online because they keep adding late payment fees on every month even though I pay my bill but refuse to pay these bogus late payment fees, they are charging late payment fees for 1 late payment fee that should have got if they simply took the money out via direct debit like they did previously, and now I struggle to get through for hours and then eventually when I get through the connection is bad and most of times I dont understand the agent on the phone properly because of the accent differences, I will cancel my contract for misspelling and NEVER GO BACK to virgin media again, I was with them for 25+ y esa are before which my mother took out and they were charging us £60+ for just basic internet with no tv packages or call plans for years when I should have been paying a third of that.",Khuram Rehmani,2021,12,2,1,0.064,0.03,Negative

When the flight was cancelled because of the pandemic he could not obtain a refund or rebook a flight and was offered vouchers amounting to about £20 in recompense .

We explicitly told them it had been cut and Virgin stated that it would be inspected and fixed before our install date. Round comes the install date and an ""engineer"" turns up and asks where the cable connection point is in the house. After a brief explanation he leaves.2nd attempt: Again spend more time than should be required trying to talk to Virgin and explain that the cable does not run to our house. Again told ""computer says YES!"". I must have spent a good 5 mins reiterating the fact there is no cable and they will have to dig up the garden to run a new cable. Anyway, a new date is set with the promise they will inspect the property. Well, second date rolls around and up turns the Engineer. Again asks where he can plug in the box. Again a total waste of everyones time and sadly it seems from the Engineers point of view that this isnt an isolated occurance.Anyway, after cancelling that order, ive decided to give them one more attempt. I spent again a considerable amount of time impressing on the operator that there was no cable, asking for them to repeat it back to me like a child, and this time its been noted that there is no cable running from the road to my house!! Yay!!!We go through the full detail about how the property will need inspected and may need a permit etc but that all this will be done prior to the first install date of 5th NovemberBut that's not the end. nope. First ""engineer"" turns up prior to the first install date and notes that, yes, there's no cable. Says he cant do anything and that others will be sent though and that will probably be the day before install. Fair enough.The 4th comes around and no-ones been. Get an email that night that Virgin need a permit to dig. Think they might have known about this straight after looking but OK. install date is moved to the 24th NovFew days later a ground crew turn up and dig in my garden to install a local box. They dont run the cable to the house from this box in my front garden on my property (this location is important!) as thats by others. Now around comes the 24th. No-one else has been to do anyworks BUT i get both an Email confirming install will be the done that day and a text message the day before again confirming install between 1pm and 6pm. They must be doing the final 3m run under my grass on the day eh? Ill cancell other plans and stay in then.At 6.30pm, after a waste of a full afternoon, I get an email from Virgin. No apology, no nothing. Just a statement that they ""need a permit for the works"" and that install is delayed even though all work is on MY PROPERTY!. Ill be contacted by my install manager. GREATAnyway. Now its the 30th Nov. Virgin again phone to arrange a new install date. never guess what - I'm informed that the system says that I'm not connected (little wins!) and that an Engineer will have to come out and survey the site to see what's required. This may need ground works and if so a Permit will be required. After explaining that this has already been done and I have a new box in my garden all i get is ""yeah, mm, yeah, understand - well and Engineer will be out soon to survey""....The level of incompetency is outstanding.

1750,I've never experienced frustration like dealing with Virgin Media.,"It took them 3 months, 7 visits and countless last minute cancellations for them to tell us that our broadband would never work because of a broken cable. We live in Central London.Virgin repeatedly said they would fix the cable but never did and we were messed around repeatedly. They don't answer emails, their call-centre staff are impossible to deal with, and all their engineers are too inexperienced to be able to do anything other than plug the router into the wall and test the connection. It's a Kafkaesque nightmare.After 3 months, one of their engineers (who had only just joined the company) told us they would never fix it because it wasn't economical for them to do so but that they would never admit that. There is no point making complaints. They ignore them or respond saying 'we didn’t want to delay things, so we’ve gone ahead and looked into a resolution for you.' The resolution always ignores the issue (we were once told our complaint couldn't be resolved until the problem was fixed).The often-quoted excuse is 'we use 3rd party contractors'. You'll get that response whenever you complain, as if that absolves them of any responsibility. They then tried to charge us for early cancellation despite us never having a functioning service. It took me quoting their own contract for them to waive the charge (they even had the cheek to say this was a goodwill gesture). We've switched to Vodaphone 5G broadband. Their service is excellent, it's roughly the same price, and I've stopped banging my head against a brick wall. Avoid them like the plague.

I said please either give a wifi dongle or apply credit for me pay for a dongle until it has been obtained. They told me they will provide a dongle for me which I gladly accepted. They said a short form needed to be filled in and then a 24 hours later I should receive a call from the team confirming this.I missed a call 48 hours later as I was in a business meeting. I called back straight away and was told once I miss the call that is it. I was told the form then has to be filled in again. I have repeated this process several times and there is apparently no way for me to get this dongle without speaking to the team.Words cannot explain how unhelpful the customer service team are. I request to speak to a manager multiple times and I am then just bounced to another department totally unrelated to my issue and more importantly - not to a manager. Call after call after call I have just been bounced around from department back to department with no success.I was previously with EE, who provided stellar service and whenever there was an issue I had to make one phone call and it was sorted.I have spent over 12 hours on the phone waiting or speaking to Virgin and my service hasn't even started.

After 3 phone calls it turns out my email and full name were completely misspelt and I could not set up a contract in my name. By the 7th phone call I finally found someone who managed to get the process in motion and I had to make a formal written declaration of 'Name Change' to change my name to my name... go figure. They then completed the process and still spelt my name wrong. Finally last week (after almost 2 months) it's correct. But Virgin still charged me an additional £35 on the plan, even though they did not advise me of this charge when buying the plan, and because I didn't receive a contract had no idea.

When I say I'm dissatisfied with this they send me to a ""customer care"" team, who somehow can only offer me worse deals than the previous person I was chatting to.After 1 hour 20minutes, they said they'd transfer me to their ""customer relations team"", to which I discover they finished working hours ago and there will be no one joining the chat for another 12 hours. Lastly, when I mention  SIM contracts, they send you off to a department that will never pick up the chat, after 1 hour in a completely separate chat no one got back to me.If you've not already been with them they'll pull everything out of the bag to get you, but after you've joined them they'll give you terrible customer service.

Appalling customer service and as a new customer I am furious at the way I have been treated.Signed up to a deal, £100 credit and free installation, £49 per month. Email received confirming the order states month 1 payment is £0, 2nd payment and thereafter £49.First bill comes through for £163. 2 months fees (which I understand to be the norm and therefore correct) and installation charges of £65. Some small print suggests that there may be some adjustments, so assume this to be the credits in lieu of the package we've signed up to. Therefore month 1 payment £0, fine.Roll forward to 18th Nov, £165 is taken from our account. Call customer services, no record of us having signed up to the deal. Concerning, but upon providing the customer service representative with screen shot of the deal and email of our order confirmation she advised someone would be in touch to discuss and would rectify the situation. No call back, just email several days later email received to say the complaint has been dealt with and £165 credit placed on our account. Not what I asked for nor what we signed up for and they should have never taken the money in the first place.Call up customer services again and the best they can do is send a cheque. Fine however, 2 days later received an email to say request has been declined. No rhyme or reason just that it has been declined and case closed. I have now had to repeat this process 3 more times, today being the final time or so I thought. Spoke to a manager finally who 100% guaranteed he had personally approved the cheque and it WILL be in the post. 10 minutes after the call, yet another email to say the request was denied!!!It amazes me that virgin can so easily take your money, but cannot give it back! Call handlers all very apologetic but can do nothing more than pass the issue on. They promise calls back but none ever received. Noone can discuss the complaint once virgin have decided the case is closed, despite no further discussion with the customer. When asking for email confirmation that the cheque will/has been sent I have been told that they cannot send emails! Over 3 hours of phone calls trying to rectify a mistake that virgin themselves have made.Trading standards will be my next port of call. Good luck to anyone needing to deal with their customer services.*Edit on 29/11/21 following Virgins reply below - this is your generic customer services number and the number I have been calling!!! Trust me, I have been asking why the cheques are being denied (after promises they will go through)  and noone can tell me. All they can offer is to start the process all over again, to which I then inevitably get an email saying the request has been denied. Even your response to my trust pilot review falls short of resolving anything and if anything is a little insulting. May as well say just call us again. Over 3 hours on the phone over 4+ calls, what difference is me calling again going to achieve. Pathetic.

Firstly the tv service was slowly losing quality and channels for me, so we went to Sky Q, but we stayed with them for there broadband! The broadband used to be great but then I noticed slow down and drop outs, every time I called Virgin I got through to someone who neither I could understand or they understand me. They always blamed my home network setup (I always ran my router in modem mode as there hub is diabolical for wifi service with modern smart homes). The final straw was the constant yearly price increases. Eventually I called up to cancel once I had FTTP Installed again through sky, it was at that point when one of there ""Agents"" laughed and said how my internet would be worse than there's using it through a sky dish! Not sure if he knew what fibre to the property actually meant! It took me over and hour to actually cancel my broadband, then the deluge of sales calls started offering me broadband for more than sky but expecting me to stay! They even called me a liar saying I hadn't given them a chance to match the price! Unless things change ill never go back and its such a shame as NTL used to be fantastic but Virgin have ruined it!

So I’m annoyed I have to pay £160 to cancel early (£10 more then I was quoted 3 days prior) Run up to Christmas other then one helpful lady no one wanted to help they just preferred to transfer me 3 times on the first call For the final one to cut me off. Second attempt I got the helpful lady who was willing to speak to her manager but couldn’t in the end lower the bill at all to help in the run up to Christmas ( not her fault company policy to s**t on a customer) She puts me through to the department I needed only to be on hold almost an hour when I get through they hang up on me. At this point I am shaking with anger that not only do I need to pay £160 to not use them I also have wasted 2 hours of my life to be hung up on twice.

1814,VM is nothing but a liar,"After 10+ phone calls battle with VM yesterday, the only thing I learnt as a new customer is that VM is nothing but a liar.I purchased a M200 board band package with £75 credit on 19/11/2021 and I chose Click and Collect for my quick-start kit which should be due to be delivered on 23/11.While it hasn’t been delivered to my chosen collect point, I message on Live Chat with Simon. He said “you can go today”- Lie no.1. The parcel was never at the collect point.When I checked the detailed tracking, it shows two attempted delivery and the parcel was returned to the depot. I called the off-license collect point, the owner said Collect+ has paused the delivery to their shop as previous parcels have taken up all the space. That means my kit will never be delivered to this collect point in short time and VM site let me choose a collect point that is not working and does not even let me choose another one.So I called VM and wish to change to another collect point, of course, I have told the agent everything including the conversation I had with the off-license owner.He said he cannot change it online so he had to call the Collect+ and will give me a callback. - Lie no.2 Of course, he is not gonna call back, what am I thinking.I called again, the same request. This time, the guy said he can cancel the original kit and send me a new kit directly to my house on 29/11 (which is 6 days later than the original 23/11). Okay fine, I accepted. And shortly after, VM send me an email saying that I will be compensated £5/delay day that is their fault.2 hours later, I received a welcome email from VM and it states that I only have £40 credit. How could you deduct my original £75 credit to £40 when it is none of my faults.I am extremely frustrated and furious, and I called again.The first person said she cannot do anything until the first bill arrived- Lie no. 3.The second person, I am too tired to repeat my story for 10 times. I asked can you tell me everything you know on the note and I will tell you the missing part.“You want to cancel the service” THE END“I will put that down in the note.” - Lie no.4 Said by every one of them, and that is what’s in the note for god sake.And of course, I had to tell the same story and that I never want to cancel the service. I just want to get my router. I asked him specifically to put these in the note that none of it is my fault as VM let me choose a non-working Collect point in the first place and I couldn’t receive my kit on the promised date. They do not say a word of their wrongdoings and try to put the blame on the customer, what a nice start to a new customer.At last, the agent did say he guaranteed there is £75 credit in my account and he will put through a rolling £2 credit each month for the entire 18 months contract period.But after all the lies I got, and basically, none of the things promised to me have been done so far, I do not have much faith in this. Until I can see £75 credit, £2 rolling credit and £5 x 6days = £30 compensation credit is clearly shown on my account and received my ROUTER, I will not believe a single word coming from Virgin Media.

1848,"Shocking broadband, even worse service",The broadband connection in my home has not worked properly since installation. On Friday 19th November 2021 it cut out for long periods/most of the working day and has been intermittent since. On Monday 22nd it cut out for the entire working day. There are also black spots in the house where the signal does not reach although the booster has helped a bit. I called on Monday to leave Virgin due to the above. I spoke to the retention team who put me through to tech support who were not helpful and only offered to call back on Weds 24th (today) which he did. On Monday I then called the retention team back and explained again that I was an unhappy and Weds was too long for just a call. Then an engineer was booked for Wednesday 24th to come out to my home. I could see it on my app. Someone was due to come between 12-4 and they did not show. I then call the retention team again and I’m told an engineer was never booked! The member of staff in Glasgow told me that all of the above was not the case as if I don’t know what’s going on with my internet in my own home. I agreed that on the days I’ve mentioned internet returns on occasion but it is not reliable and the household is working from home with duties and meetings. He told me that I do not pay for guaranteed WiFi and to check my contract as Virgin only guarantee internet to the router. I told him even when I plug in it doesn’t work but he insists it does. He then went on to tell me that “WiFi is a privilege and not guaranteed”. I was shocked. I hope this was his error and not policy. I am paying for the internet to work and it does not work to my satisfaction. It is that simple. This is unacceptable. Virgin advertise broadband. That’s what I’m paying for. I made a formal complaint and was given a robotic standard email response and directed back to the same team I mentioned above.

I tried to do this using the online system but it did not support cancellation. I tried using the online chat function but tyhey kept me waiting until I lost the will to live. I emailed Virgin who insisted that I phone their retention team. I tried to phone the retention team and sat in a phone queue until my patience was exhausted. I lodged a complaint through the Virgin Complaints process and asked to be contactred by email. Virgin phoned me while I was driving and left a message asking me to call them. I tried and sat in another phone queue for a while. I kept emailing with no success so took the case to CEDR (meanwhile, Virgin were still debiting the monthly bills for as service that I was not receiving). I received an offer from Virgin as follows:- ""£250.00 compensation, as a gesture of goodwill....Cancel your services free of charge. Once again, please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused as a result of the delay in cancelling your services"". It was now 29/7/21 so I reluctantly accepted expecting the money to be credited to my account. Nothing happened so I followed up and Virgin told me that it was company policy to only offer refunds by cheque. I eventually received a cheque for £250 but Virgin were still debiting my account £25.85 per month. I received approximately 10 calls from the Virgin Retention team asking if there was anything they could do to retain my business. My account was cancelled in Sept but my money was not refunded and Virgin does not accept complaints from cancelled accounts so I went back to CEDR and raised a further complaint. Virgin challenged this under CEDR terms and conditions saying that a complaint cannot be accepted if it relates to a previous complaint. I responded saying that Virgin had failed to properly deal with the previous complaint but CEDR upheld Virgin's position.

1875,Virgin spitefulness,"We were with Virgin for over 20 years and have just changed to a new provider for broadband and landline phone.

Our new provider was so apologetic about this, we even got a credit for something that isn't their fault!Our new broadband speed is much lower than the 150 that Virgin claimed we were getting. But our broadband is now working fantastically well, so much better than the constant disconnect we were getting with Virgin!On top of that, our new provider's customer service is outstanding. No more arguing with Virgin reps in a different country who you can barely understand because their English is so bad.I have lost the phone number I had for over 20 years due to Virgin's spitefulness, but I have gained a fantastic new provider. Never again, Virgin!Edit: In reply to Virgin's comment on this post: Virgin have a choice to make a number obsolete or to release the number to other providers for future use. Other providers release the numbers of customers who cancelled, with the aim that they can be picked up and transferred to the new provider. But not Virgin! Virgin takes the number out of the system to ensure that it can never be used again! I would call such action extremely petty and vindictive! And there is no point trying to complain to Virgin. We have tried this for the past few years. It gets you absolutely nowhere and only causes stress. The useless Virgin customer service staff either don't speak English properly, don't understand you, make you wait in endless queues for hours on end with the aim to give you the same repeat speech a hundred times over; or they simply cut you off.

1884,Unauthorised payments taken without any purchases,"Hi, I think it's important for people to be aware of the tactics Virginmedia is deploying to pocket your money without you making any purchases from them and without you giving them the explicit consent that you want to purchase any new services or devices from them. They did charge me for the equipment I never purchased from them and never used and did not even know why they sent it to me. I called them at the beginning of October and they said they would refund me, not even saying sorry for what they had done. A month later I could see no refund in my bank statement and I called them again. No apology, no refund. My next contact is going to be a request for the deadlock letter. The most important bit to be aware of, instead of you contacting them and purchasing new services or equipment they can send you something and bill you for it. With all the scams around I never click links sent to me via texts which makes it a perfect scam for Virgin text you and send you whatever they want and charge you for it. It is forced onto you. Also they use your mobile phone for marketing purposes even in case you did not give them permission to use your personal details for their own marketing. I think the Regulator must be advised on Virgin using your card details to take the money for new service or equipment without your consent. I have been their customer for 15+ years, this is the final straw and I am waiting for the last day of the current contract for them never ever to have my card details again as they have abused it. I also advise you to check your monthly bills as you might not be aware that they are doing it to you. When it is tough to sell something to the customers they just can send it to you and ""hey presto!"" they sold something to you even though you never made a purchase and  didn't want to buy any extra services from them in the first place.

1892,Shocking Broadband Connection,Changed my broadband and mobile to Virgin from EE a few months ago and have regretted it since. I haven’t noticed any improvement in broadband speed but what I have had is frequent problems with the broadband dropping out which I never had previously. It’s made working at home impossible and I’ve had to resort to using my mobile data for online meetings. When I told Virgin Media that I was having to use my data allowance because of the poor broadband they weren’t interested and wouldn’t compensate me. Their latest suggestion was that I should buy signal boosters for the broadband even though I never had any problems anywhere in the house with EE. I thoroughly regret signing up to Virgin but am now unfortunately stuck in a contract with them.,Oliver Lewis,2021,11,23,1,0.161,0.039,Negative
