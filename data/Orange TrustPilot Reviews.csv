1,Don't use staff advice.,"Walked into the branch to upgrade my contract. Come out with an unwanted downgrade. Be careful going in there before doing your research first. I came in for Samsung s21 but was mis-sold samsung a52s. Advisor kept telling me that this is the latest and best version. I trusted their knowledge. As I got back home and unpacked it, I realised its a cheap budged phone. What a downgrade from my previous one. And I'm now fixed into 12 month contract.

6,They can't do the job.,I phoned EE a month ago to get an unlocking code. It took half an hour to get through on the phone. I was told the unlocking team would contact me in 4 days. They didn't. I spent another half hour trying to get through to someone at EE.This time I was told actually the unlocking team would contact me in 10 working days. They didn’t. I then spent another half hour trying to get through to the useless customer service dept. They said the unlocking team were mothballed/furloughed/non existent/incommunicado. They didn’t know what to do so they gave me the email address of the escalation team unlocking-escalations(at)ee.co.uk and told me I would be contacted the next day. The next day no one contacted me. I emailed the escalation team. No one emailed back. I emailed them again. No one emailed back. I emailed them again. No one emailed back. It is clear this company is manifestly incompetent. They advertise services on their website that they do not actually provide. They are incapable of answering the phone in under ten minutes. And the people who answer the phone say things that are simply not true. Do not waste your time or money having anything to do with this company. UPDATE: I posted the above on their community forum.

Conveniently I guess!! So it boils down to whatever They say is the end of the matter! I’ve wasted more than 2 hours from one person to the other saying the same thing over and over!

Since that date, i have not received the service, not has the technician installed the router. yesterday after my frustration led me to cancel with Orange, I was informed that the cancellation for a service that was NOT provided would take between 5 - 15 days. Their  agent just informed me now that it would take 15 days to cancel the service they failed to provide. This is a company that cannot keep their word with their clients.

32,Their aim is to suck money out of your…,"Their aim is to suck money out of your account without letting you know. I topped up £15 to buy a pack. My balance still showed zero so I checked whether I had bought a pack. Nothing showing, so I topped up £15 and went to buy a pack. Now I had a balance of£15 as well as a £15 pack which EE had evidently bought for me. I called EE support (every call to sort out a problem costs £0.25) and they told me the system 'won't update' for an hour or so. So the computer which took the payment and bought the pack, displays incorrect information. Neither would they repay the top up.This pack according to EE text was good 'until' yesterday, when I had a £13+ balance. Yesterday morning they told me my pack would end this morning. This morning I topped up and my balance is £1.70. Looking at my bill, which doesn't include data (apparently it's too difficult to show that, although they are able to charge), there's £0.45 for 3 texts yesterday. My assumption is that they took around £11 for data yesterday but there's no way to check. Either way they reminded me this morning that my pack expired and I needed to buy a new one.Unfortunately the only way to keep EE from sucking money out my bank account is to keep a zero balance and top up when things stop working. Next time I'll try to switch to a credit card so that I've got some recourse for EE's non-performance.Btw, the International Operator is 155 for which they charge over £2 just to call. I got hit by this when I mis-keyed EE's number, 150. Their choice of number and charges seems designed to take advantage of mistakes.",John Russell,2018,6,28,1,0.058,0.06,Positive

40,Have been with this network for years - AVOID AVOID now,"Have been with this network for years (when it used to be the old Orange company) as a business phone user - never any problems - but problems have now started when EE decided to scrap paper invoices.  We did not get the December paper invoice (that would happen as EE never mailed it to us), then get a threating message over the phone about non-payment.  Contacted the Darlington service centre, to agree that a paper invoice must be sent out (at our cost £1.99) and agreed time period for the payment to get back to EE - 14th February.    Great what happens today - 2nd Feb  - EE shutdown the phone because of non payment (we have actually paid the bill !!).  Contact EE again today - get stuck with some cretin  - where you have to explain everything 3 times to her - I give up with EE, tell them I want to take the number to another network and this **** tells me she wants £454.27 off me, before she will give me the PAC code.   So this network is happy that it's customers have no business phone service only because of change in their own internal procedures and then when the customer is trying to get communications back up, do everything to block the resolution to the problem.

Once i took the phone home and tried using it i discovered the sliding to be difficult. Returned to the store and politely asked to exchange it where the assistant asked the manager to assist. WOW! What a mistake that was. The woman was awful and insulting.She said she'd no problem using it and when i showed how it was difficult for me she more or less said tough. I'd been with this company for years and was astonished at her inability to see how disability could affect a person.Left in disgust and contacted their head office.

47,THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND LEAST LOYAL,"THE MOST EXPENSIVE MOBILE PHONE PROVIDER (based on their 'extensive coverage' argument, alone) I LEAVE YOU WITH TWO EXPERIENCES - YOU BE THE JUDGE.1) I had broadbaand and landline with them for two years - all my bills paid instantly via direct debit. I move house - they refuse to give me the same service at my new address, because 'you didnt pass the credit check'.Another case of ''computers says no'', thick, corporate horror.IN my eyes the real credit check is my flawless, responsible behaviour towards them during my tenancy at that address. My perfect record for the entire four years. Are you saying that, after that, just because my credit check on a computer says I am not solvent you are going to go with that instead of your experience with me? NOT LOYAL . I WILL NEVER USE EE AGAIN.2) I Had a mobile phone on PAYG, with them too, but from before my landline /broadband days at the aforementioned address, I never charged it because i rely on landline , but when I did or when i had to , as was the case during my in-between-addresses period, god, did i get ripped off!

48,ACTUALLY NO STAR GIVEN ... ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL COMPANIES,"Honestly wouldn't even give them a star but unfortunately you have to give at least one to put an opinion in. Left Orange in January 2015 when I upgraded my phone and was told I would then become a customer of EE. All went well to a degree until I was checking my Credit report on Friday and there was a default on my report for a company I knew nothing about - Lowell. So I googled this company and contacted them and was told it was for an outstanding Orange bill of £33. I am still with EE (is Orange not part of EE????) to this date and this has never come up even when I upgraded again in January this year. My credit report which outlines my payment history with Orange is all clear no defaults ever added no late payments just states payments made on time. Almost 3 years after I left Orange this other company Lowell have added a default onto my credit report and now I will be unable to get credit due to an apparent default for £33!!!! No bills ever received, no letters sent chasing payment no phone calls no nothing!!! Spoke to EE and they have been absolutely no help whatsoever kept getting passed over to the non English speaking Orange (No before you say I'm not being racist but they can't understand a word I say and I cant understand them) who can't understand a word I'm saying and have no idea what I'm talking about. Asked for a copy of the bill and other correspondence sent as they are stating the bill is due to me not providing 30 days notice to Orange for moving to EE which they can't provide - not opposed to paying the £33 but need to know exactly why I'm paying and what for! - No sorry we can't provide that evidence you just have to pay Lowell ... but for what and why 3 years and i am only just finding out about this. Absolutely disgraceful customer service from both companies. Surely as a loyal customer to Orange and EE for many years, EE would try to help resolve this situation. I have been told now that even if I make this payment this default will stay on my account for 6 years - Lowell have nicely added the date of default as March 2017 so that's me not being able to apply for credit successfully until 2023!!!! Cant even leave EE as I still have a long time left on my contract and the payment I'd have to pay to leave would be daylight robbery! I would never recommend this company to anyone",Leanne Russell,2017,10,30,1,0.073,0.138,Positive

Which harressed me that my phone service will cut off, it would afftect my credit ratings and blah blah.

I am on the Dolphin package and had 3 Magic Numbers allocated (you pay 30p for a call to on another Orange number for a maximum 60 minute call). Last year I discovered I was being charged full price for these calls. I phoned Orange (EE now) and they said Magic Numbers have been discontinued; however, they would give me unlimited calls to EE numbers for three months. Great! This continued up until recently; all I had to do every three months was ring EE to have the calls reset . However, last week I phoned EE and they said they would no longer offer this service and I would be better switching to EE from Orange as Orange would cease to exist. Strange when my friends still have Magic Numbers with Orange !!!Needless to say I will be leaving Orange (EE) for a more competitive provider.

I applied for a car a few months ago and got declined because of this debt for £18!!!!!! And now I've received a letter off ORANGE saying they have passed this £18.68 debt onto Lowell group. I've called orange today only to be passed to EE, I spoke to Wayne who was brilliant and spoke to someone at Orange who wouldn't speak to me and then someone in collections at orange again who wouldn't speak to me and just said tell her to pay it with Lowell. I've paid the £18.68 that wasn't a problem I'm furious at the fact I've called twice and been told I didn't owe anything and now this has affected my credit file.

56,They're a Joke,"Switched from another provider to EE, I live out in the country where internet service is dire at the best of times, they promised me faster. Hmmmm how wrong was that, not only where they not faster they weren't as fast as their predecessors, in fact most of the time it dropped out. Then you go onto their website to try and find out what the problem is, try to log into your account and surprise surprise you get ""the page you're trying to reach is down at the minute and will be back soon, we are performing maintenance to make it faster for you"" you try to call and you get put on hold for an hour then it cuts off. So when BT finally got their fibre up my way off course I was going to jump at it. Now I have a mobile phone account with EE and when I took out the broadband I paid a years line rental up front. So when I got a letter from them saying that because I'm going to another supplier before the end of my contract I would have to pay £128. Even though I'd paid line rental up front. They told me that it was a breach in contract. I said ""well while you are on that subject, you told me you would supply me with faster broadband, you told me I would have internet. Take a look at my mobile phone bill and see all those times the data was used up on my phone? Well that is because the internet you promised to provide had dropped out and I had to connect through my mobile"" ""so who is in breach of contract"".

Apart from that the service is phenomenal, constantly updated with any mast outages and engineer service intervals. The customer service at EE is a little hit and miss.

65,No problem with service until I cancelled my contract,"I have had a orange mobile for many years without a problem, admittedly I didn't use it much and paid them by direct debit on time every month. In January I  rang to cancel, after about 10 mins of trying to talk me out of it they finally agreed to cancel the contract, or so I thought. On Saturday I checked my credit report to find out orange had put a black mark on my account for non payment, spoke to a very nice lady at orange who confirmed they had spoken to me in January to cancel the account and she would sort it out and make sure my account is cancelled and the outstanding balance credited. Today I received a letter demanding the money and telling me my phone will be disconnected. Rang again to find out the lady I spoke to on Saturday had not done what she promised and again they promised to sort it out., not a word of an apology or acknowledgement that I had spent good money ringing them to sort their mess out. Hopefully this will be the end of it.

I have checked my credit report recently as I am about to take out a mortgage and it is showing quite a few late payments to them in 2013 and 2014. I contacted orange to find out what this was for. They advised me that this is incorrect and I should email the credit department to request that this was removed. I did this for them to come back to me and advise that the late payments are correct and the credit history will remain the same. I then contacted orange after this on a few occasions where they repeatedly told me there are no late payments. I have now emailed the credit department to advise this about 4 times and they still haven't removed the history from my credit report. Feeling absolutely fed up of this now, I contacted orange customer service again to advise that I've heard nothing and I need to get my mortgage sorted out as I have had an offer accepted on a property. They advised me that the reason why the late payments are showing is because they never closed my account as requested meaning that they were still requesting payments from me when they shouldn't have been. They then noticed this a few months later and wiped the balance and closed down the account but have not removed this from my credit history. They have advised me today that they will email the credit department to get this removed and i should here back within 7 days. This is an appalling service as i need to get my mortgage approved by tomorrow in order to get things moving with the estate agents but cannot until this is removed from my credit history.

After my Orange contract ended, they continued to take payments for the following 3 months!!!

I haven't used that phone or network for 8 months and they have charged me for all of it. 5 months to the end of the contract I was comfortable paying but 3 months after the contract is ridiculous.

I had to prove why they should not help themselves!!!! and when I did they took months to act on it. I asked for an account statement and noticed that I was being charged 5.6.7 and up to 10 times for a single text message. I asked then to investigate and rectify,They refused. Finally in the last month of the contract I  asked them to issue a balancing statement taking the overcharging into account they refused. I withheld final months payment until this was done, in retaliation they blocked my account. and to add insult to injury referred me to their rothwhiler debt collection agency Lowell who issued a default on my credit record.

I remember being on hold for over 30 minutes when I decided to end call and make a new call. Again Orange wanted to put me on hold. I requested to speak to a supervisor however I was told there isn't one available and then decided to hang up on me. Orange refused to help me and told me to keep waiting. I was losing my patience as I have already been waiting for 3 weeks. They were passing me from one department to another. I spend almost 2 and half hours on the phone.

115,Absolutely shocking customer service!!!,"I have been a customer with orange for around 6 years now, orange is by far the worst network provider I have ever come across.  Back in October 2014 I requested a signal box as my signal was shocking and I was unable to make or receive calls without my phone cutting off.  Orange said they would send me a signal box free of charge because I was a loyal customer - I moved house in December 2014. The signal was even worse, absolutely no bars and my phone wouldn't even ring - it would go straight to my voicemail if somebody tried to call me. In January I decided to change network providers and so I requested my PAC code from orange. I was passed around to 3 different people, I seemed to be ignored each time I asked the simple question 'could I have my pac code please? ' I was given the pac code and also received a text message containing it. I was told it would be £99.17 to leave orange and that it would automatically appear on my account but I was told that I had until the 15th Feb to pay that amount. I had numerous texts and calls about my account being overdue, even though I hadn't actually used the PAC code. (it lasts for 30 days)I decided against using the PAC code to see if my orange signal would improve.  Big mistake!!! I rung up to pay my bill at the start of feb and to say that I had decided to stay with orange ... I was told that the £99.17 would be credited when my next bill is generated on 17th Feb as the PAC code hadn't been used.I chased orange 4 times alone in Feb to see if it had been credited.  It hadn't!!!! I was told it would be credited by the saturday (5 days later) On the saturday there was still no credit. So I chased yet again to be told ANOTHER date it would be credited by!!At this point I was receiving text messages to say that my account was overdue and that I needed to pay immediately!!! I rung 4th March to pay my months bill. The £99.17 was STILL showing and I angrily asked why after all the false promises. I was told that by paying my bill it would clear up the £99.17. What!!! Why wasn't I told this before????I explained that my signal was shocking (after having to ask them to call me back on my land line) I was put through to another department and told that a signal box would be sent out.I was told that because of the inconvenience of never receiving it after requesting one back in October that a £50 credit would be applied onto my account.  I received the signal box within 5 days.Today I received the following text message :Hi from Orange, your Orange bill is due for payment immediately and failure to do so will result in suspension of your service. To make payment or to speak to an advisor call 07973100178.I rung orange regarding this text message as my bill wasn't generated until the 17th March so why am I expected to pay it now, a week later!!! I explained that a £50 credit should be on my account so in actual fact I have no bill to pay. Orange said that £36 was outstanding for this months bill, the £99.17 had been refunded as 2 different payments so that was a mess on my account and the £50 credit I was promised for inconvenience hadn't been credited - after explaining the whole situation and being on hold 3 times during a 40 minute conversation I have been told that I will receive the credit on my account and that they will call me on Friday - which I highly doubt. I am due for an early upgrade on 31st March but I am now waiting until May until my contract ends and to gladly leave orange. Communication between staff is shocking and Customer service is shocking!!! You can barely understand them and the amount of times you are passed from pillar to post is disgusting.

About two weeks ago my HTC one mini stared to loose charge after only a few hours, so after a few days I rang Orange/EE to try and get things sorted.  After about a hour on the phone I was told the phone and possibly the cable were both faulty and they would send me a replacement.  I was asked if I would accept a new HTC one mini 2 so said yes.  On the Sunday morning I had problems trying to back up all my data so rang Orange again.  An hour or so passed and they were unable to help so was told the only thing I could do was refuse the delivery on Sunday and ring back during the week so that the technical team could try and help me.  Unfortunately early Morning I was taken ill (I have a life ling medical complex medical condition) and ended up in hospital.  Not having a working mobile left me very stressed and in hospital for longer than necessary.  On Wednesday, when I had recuperated  I rang Orange again and finally managed to get my data backed up.  Again I explained my faulty cable and the fact that my SIM card was stuck in my devise.  I was told not to worry as my new mobile would have a new different sized SIM and a new cable.  I arranged my delivery for the Thursday evening.  However, when my 'new' phone arrived, it was not a new HTC one mini 2 but reconditioned HTC one mini. I rang Orange disgusted and was kept on hold whilst they tried to sort it out, essentially being made to feel like a liar about being offered the HTC one mini 2.  Any way to cut a long story short, having spent a total of over 7 hours on the phone to Orange in just over a week, I am no further forward.  I have been lied to as was told every mobile company only offers reconditioned phones as a replacement when I have since been told by other companies they replace with new.  I have tried to go into 2 different branches on Sundays to try and get it sorted only to find that the branches are closed, when every other phone shop is open (Orange stores use to be open!) and have been made to feel like a liar.  I have actually written this whole review whilst being 'on hold' again whilst some bloke in India tries to 'sort it out' but I doubt he is going to be able to do anything as they never can!

126,Lost a customer of 12 years,"I have been a customer of orange for 12 years. In terms of the phone service I have always been happy - good reception, reasonable bills and no loss of service. When my contract comes up for review I always shop around to get the best deal and up until this year Orange have been able to match deals from their competitors. The problem was cancelling my contract. The first call took me 20 minutes to get through to discuss the price match. I then called back a day later to cancel the contract - this call took 43 minutes before I gave up. The next call a day later and I was again on hold for half an hour before I gave up. The third I final call I was on hold for 30 minutes before someone answered, took a few details and then put me back in another queue for 23 minutes!

Nine calls to Orange customer care have made no difference whatsoever. Promises of a fix within fourteen days have never materialised. A direct email to the CEO elicited a nil response. A recent phone call to tech services took nearly 35 mins did not resolve the issue and the sim card is now inoperable. Orange are now in breach of their contract.

So on 13th october Orange sent me a letter i got it the 20th 21st i rung them to see why this letter says i owe 142.53 and i got no where i was talked to like a child and when i said i didnt understand she said do you understand or not.

Call back again and they put me through to billing who agree to help and then cut me off.  They don't call back even thought they know who I am and have my number.  Just couldn't face another 20 minutes on hold being told how they didn't expect many people to call them today despite lots of people calling them every other day......hmmmmNext step - fill in an official complaint on their website and a complaint with OFCOM and you think that might elicit a response - no not a bit of it - glorious silence.  Just waiting the 7 days so I can complain to the complaints service approved by OFCOM.Such a shame that a good business is being destroyed from within by greed and stupidity.  Poor customer service and excessive charges don't engender repeat business.  Thinking of going with EE.

167,Disgusted with Orange EE customer service,"I have been an orange customer for many many years and up until now  they've been great. I've taken out a number of 24 month contracts with them over the years and for my loyalty Orange gave me a 15% discount. Their customer service used to be excellent. I have an iPhone 5 and with my discount I pay £23 per month for unlimited minutes, unlimited text messages and 5G of data per month.My latest contract has been running for just over 2 years and this timed perfectly with the iPhone 6 release so I phoned Orange and after being on hold for a good 20 minutes was told that the best they could do for me is for me to pay £250 upfront for the phone and then £39 per month for 24 months thereafter and my data allowance would go down to 1G per month. The total payable would be £1,186.  I did not go ahead with the upgrade and after some thought called Orange again to see if they could offer me a better deal. The man I spoke to said that I could pay £220 for the phone and with my discount, only £27 per month for 2G of data. Much better. This only totals £868.  I decided to go ahead with this upgrade deal. He told me he'd just put me on hold for a few second while he sorts it out. Then instead of putting me on hold, he cut me off!!!I phoned Orange again and was again on hold for another 20 minutes. I explained that I'd been cut off. She told me the man I'd spoken to before had not put any notes on my account so I went through it all again. I was then told that I'd been given incorrect information and that I'd have to pay £329.99 for the phone and £28 per month (after 15% discount). Then she queried my loyal customer discount and told me that I'd have to give this up because Apple won't allow any discount with the iPhone 6.  Thus I would have to pay £33 per month plus the £330 for the phone totalling £1,122.  My discount is for my loyalty to Orange, not Apple so all those years as an Orange customer don't mean a thing if I want the iPhone 6 upgrade. I'm utterly disgusted with having been given 3 different prices each time I called for the same product and then told that basically my loyalty means sweet FA anymore. I'm not sure that Orange deserve my loyalty anymore to be honest.",Victoria Gooders,2014,9,15,1,0.041,0.114,Positive
168,"Never, ever Orange again.","I cancelled 3 of the 4 phones on my Orange contract, paying all the extra involved in paying up on each phone  up to the date each contract ended. On my next bill I was still charged for all 4 phones. I was put through to no less than SEVEN assistants when I rang them. I was told yes, they had received full payment but no-one would say that my latest bill was incorrect. Said it was a ""group"" and cancellation couldn't be done easily. What rot. They also said they would phone back but never did. I've just tried to get my PAC code - with much delaying tactics from Orange - but have managed it. I'll cancel my DD and wait for my final bill, which, if I think it is correct, I will pay over the phone. I am happy to pay off my remaining contract until Jan 2015 just to be shut of Orange.  2 yrs ago They managed to make errors resulting in me getting a poor credit rating. I contacted the Daily Mail who intervened on my behalf and it was put right - a nightmare for a few weeks.   Orange are bothered ONLY about money, never customer satisfaction. You'll be OK until there is a problem then you will be in deep, thick soup! Orange have had thousands of pounds from me - I must be their best payer ever. This is the way they treat good customers.

For starters, I was owed a refund because they had made the mistake of not cancelling my old phone line on my move from Orange to EE. So I was paying double for my phone. Then I was told I was owed different amounts by different employees, some said £120, some said 'Oh they didn't add VAT on so you'll be getting £160 back and it will go in your bank this week'. A couple of weeks later I phone back and they inform me I will be getting a cheque (not a bank refund) and my account was credited that month so I wouldn't be paying any bills until September. Then I get texts saying my bills hadn't been paid for that month, despite being told I wouldn't pay anything.  I also tried to lower my monthly iPad payments and a lovely lady said this was possible. A week later I ring back to check the progress and get 'Oh sorry we can't do that'. What is wrong with this company?

172,NEVER EVER EVER USE ORANGE/EE,"I took out a contract with Orange in December 2011 for 24 months.  This was a contract for an iPhone and iPad with 2GB of data to use between both devices per month.  For the first 6 months they charged me for the data I had used on my iPad, even though at no time did I go over my monthly limit on the contract.  My calculations show that I was owed over 200 pounds.I contacted Orange countless times over the next few months.  I ended up with a single contact and all she kept telling me was that this was a recognised problem and that the refunds team were dealing with it.  She did not resolve the problem for me.  We are now in 2014 and I'm still waiting.Unsurprisingly I decided to vote with my feet when my contract expired.  I diverted to O2.  I called Orange to obtain my PUK code and cancel my account, the very next day I received a call from someone at Orange/EE asking why I had chosen to leave.  When I explained they took very little interest and made no attempt to suggest sorting the issue or looking into a refund.  He was more interested in saying ""we can give you a better offer, you have a cooling off period with O2 and we can cancel it with them"", I think not.Due to my untrusting nature of Orange/EE I cancelled my direct debit with them, I was half expecting that they would continue to take money from my account.  I received a number of letters from them saying that I owed 29.40 on my account.  I made attempts to contact Orange, again, very unhelpful customer service staff had no idea where to direct my call.  After a number of calls I simply informed them that I wasn't paying as they owed me more money.To my amazement I received a letter from a debt collection company for this amount.  Despite my protestations, my defence being that Orange owed my over 6 times what they say I owed them, they made numerous threats to take legal action and each time I made contact with them requesting they make contact with Orange to dispute this they would add a fee.I made direct contact with Orange myself via the complaint page on the website, after receiving an automated response I am one week on with no reply, surprise surprise.I decided to pay the outstanding amount.  Despite me wholeheartedly feeling and clearly being wronged by this company, in no way can I compete with them and afford to take this dispute to court.I will now be making an official complaint to OFCOM.Despite being a loyal customer to Orange for over 10 years, I feel very very angry at the way I was treated and dealt with.I will never ever use Orange/EE again and I urge customers looking to sign up to a new provider to avoid EE at all costs.",James Griffin,2014,8,25,1,0.114,0.057,Negative

I went away for the week and have returned home to still, NO SIGNAL. So I phoned up again to complain to have them tell me that they do not know when the mast will be fixed.. And that for the meantime I will get a signal booster, yet I still have to wait 7 days for that!! I expected that they would at least offer me a reduction in my contract bill as I'm paying to use a crappy service. Their response was that because my phone has been used there will be no discount. The only reason I was able to use my phone was because I was out of the area!!! I would have had no signal otherwise. This is beyond a joke and I now have to wait another week without signal.

When i called back in march/april/may to finalise me moving to different company i thought people done their work and ill be free from orange/ee at last. But i was wrong after a few months ive been receiving bills for orange contract (the one that i no longer have) so they changed tactic saying i owe them money which i didnt (always paid by dd). Spoke to someone for the 100+ time and explained the situation the guy understood and after a few time conversation he told me he will speak to his supervisor about it. He came back to me that his supervisor agreed for me to pay only £10 out of £81.06 bill. But i told them i wont pay nothing because i dont owe anything to them and ever £10 i have no reason to go out of my pocket to do so. I have been told next day by the same person that the amount was waved and he apologised for the inconvenience as per they system issues re my cancellation.

Still no phone, called again today and asked them to call me back because I had borrowed a mobile to call them as orange doesn't work inside house and they refused because it would cost them money, I was speechless! Again I have been told that my phone will hopefully be working in 2-4 working days, if not I was to call back and ask for an engineer visit, guess what? They sent an engineer today but again I was out so they couldn't fix the problem. Orange I have also found haven't redirected my calls either so really not happy.

The handset has been replaced I believe (at least) 3 times. For approx 12months of the contract, I have had major issues with the reception I received - at both of my addresses in Nottingham AND Northampton. Throughout this ordeal, it was a NIGHTMARE trying to explain my situation and find a suitable resolution. I was given misleading information as to the problem, EVENTUALLY finding out it was because several of their mobile signal masts were 'down', Yet I was paying approx £50 for the 'service' i.e. not being able to make/receive calls/texts for 80-90% of the time. Furthermore, there have been a total number of TWO price increases on my Orange mobile plan. Both apparently in line with inflation at 2.7% (and both within 6 months!!!!) I'm really in no position to be speaking about economics but regardless, I fail to believe they aren't making enough money. Moreover, when you sign up to a 24month contract, the least I expect is to pay the amount in which you sign up for. The increases were nominal amounts such as £1, (I'm sure you'll all agree this isn't a fortune but it is merely the principal!).Anyway, will absolutely be taking my business elsewhere and NEVER EVER to return to Orange/EE again.Please please please listen to all of the negative reviews - it isn't just a case of a few people having bad experiences with Orange/EE!Please please please just avoid Orange at all costs.Thanks (if you've made it this far!)",Ollie,2014,5,9,1,0.112,0.1,Negative

216,1* IS TOO HIGH A RATING FOR ORANGE/EE,"This is not just the worst phone company I've ever dealt with but the worst company of any type I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. Ofcom is a total waste of space and does nothing about the way customers like Orange/EE abuse customers at all. How many times do we have to listen to the Oh so monotonous and totally meaningless: ""Orange is committed to providing excellent customer service so your call may be recorded for customer training purposes""!!?? The words 'excellent customer service' are oxymoronic in relation to Orange/EE. As for calls being recorded - sadly none of mine ever are. The latest episode is about my last ridiculous bill - not quite four figures - and after complaining numerous times spending hours waiting, was told by a supervisor not to worry - my entire bill would be refunded. WOW! I should have known that something too good to be true - was just that - too good to be true. I asked him to send me a text to confirm it. No text. 4 days later I did receive a text, it told me to pay my bill or risk being cut off! More hours wasted on bank holiday Monday and finally found another supervisor who told me he had spoken to the original one and not to worry my whole bill was definitely being refunded and I would see it in my next bill in early May. Again, I asked him to confirm it by text which he said he would do immediately. He did not. A few days later I tried making a call and was told that my phone was barred and to call the dreaded 150. That second supervisor had apparently made a note that he had explained my entire bill and told me that I needed to pay it all. Amazing - 2 supervisors with the same line - and now it is my word against theirs. As I write I'm waiting to speak to that second supervisor again. Until then my phone remains barred! Well, Orange/EE may think they will win this battle but they will not win the war. It is said that on average you tell one person for every good customer service story you have but ten people for every bad one. I will be happy to tell 100 million just how dreadful my experience is. If this were the first time I would maybe not be quite so angry. But since I started my contract with Orange their service has been consistently terrible.

218,Incompetent and indifferent,"All I want from a mobile 'phone company is one with good network coverage (i.e. so my 'phone actually works) and reasonable prices. Does that sound unreasonable? If I can avoid dealing with customer services, so much the better. However, Orange makes this very difficult. Having come to the end of my contract, which included paying for a new 'phone, I wanted to reduce my monthly cost (since otherwise, I'm paying Orange for a 'phone and getting nothing in return). I'd worked out how many minutes/texts/MB of data I wanted, then went online. No good: the website told me to call (the dreaded) 150. Dealing with these people would be a comedy if it wasn't so painful. Some Orange staff are competent and helpful (albeit not necessarily capable of undoing the damage done by the 90% that appear to be untrained imbeciles); the remainder seem to be a waste of oxygen. My main gripe with Orange's customer services is that they cannot be trusted to provide you with accurate information. Do NOT believe them. Even when asked direct questions, they do not necessarily know what they are talking about (or, like a pantomime donkey, they don't appreciate what someone else within Orange will do). Can my 'phone be used in Japan? Orange=Yes! Reality=No, it's a GSM 'phone and Japan uses PCS. Will my 'phone work until I put the new SIM in? Orange=Yes! Reality=No, it will be blocked and your 'phone won't work at all. Can I be put through to someone that can help? Orange=Yes! Reality=I got put through to someone in ""broadband sales"". That about sums it up really... hence all I can do is move away to another operator and hope that their customer services either i) don't need to be used or ii) aren't so incompetent as Orange's. (It wouldn't be so bad if, while you're waiting 20 minutes to get through, you aren't reminded every 30 seconds that Orange ""are committed to *excellent* customer services"".

Phone up ""oh sorry we tried repair and it didnt work, therefor it is no longer our liability, its Samsungs problem please contact them"" - even though under the set product laws stating that who ever sells you the product takes the responsibility in ensuring that product works - OK apparently Orange contract voids laws now? so i go back into store ""oh sorry we can send it off again, we get three tries to repair the phone before we actually do anything"" so that is 3 months worth of £45 bills i have to pay before anything happenes with my phone. I am an electrical engineer, its a £6 repair for a new SIM holder. Also, if you provide the phone it is your responsibility, (As much as the manager in the shop was sure) you do not just provide the sim and service and it is not my responsibility to magic a phone up so i can carry on using your service.

221,Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!,I was contacted by orange to sign up for Landline and broadband. I explained that I was already in a contract with another provider for another 8 months. orange said they would pay the outstanding balance to the other company in order for me to move to Orange. I said I wanted to keep my number. No problem was there reply. Simply contact your existing supplier two weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across. I did as instructed and was asked by my provider why I was moving considering I had £180 to pay for cancelling my contract. I explained Orange had agreed to pay the balance. My current provider said that Orange had been saying this to customers but in truth they only pay up to £100. I had been mis-sold the deal and contacted Orange to cancel the switch.,,,,,,,,
Orange said they would cancel the switch immediately. However they didn't. Instead they switched my landline and broadband to them anyway.They had also given me a new landline number. I contacted them immediately. They told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went ahead. As a result I was left without a landline or Broadband for 4 weeks until Orange could switch me back to my previous provider. I lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience. The Orange customer service were rude and although I was promised phone calls from supervisors they just didnt bother. They did however send me a cheque for £30 after I had wrote several complaint letters to them. This was pathetic considering the major inconvenience I had suffered.

223,Once we have your money - customers can go to hell,"My wife and I visit the UK each year. This year we each had new iPhones and we wanted to transfer the Orange 'pay as you go' accounts previously set up on our old phones to our new iPhones.  Our journey started with a visit the EE shop in Oracle Shopping Centre, Reading, where we added GBP10 to each account and had new SIM cards set up in both our iPhones.  We had one old phone still working and this would be disconnected with the changeover.  We were promised within 2 hours both our iPhones would be connected. After 24 hours and no service on iPhones, we went back to the shop where the salesman checked everything out and apologised for the poor service. He rang 'customer services' and the agent personally guaranteed our iPhones would be connected within 2 hours - or sooner.After 4 days and many fruitless calls to 'customer services', we went to Vodafone but just as we were about to sign up, the first iPhone connected to Orange and the other iPhone connected about half an hour later.  In both cases the 'welcome' messages from Orange had been sent the day before, showing it takes at least 24 hours for things to happen internally within Orange.Our observations about Orange: 1. Calls to customer services go to agents based in India.  It costs you 25 pence to speak to a 'customer service agent' and you have to wait about 15 to 20 minutes to get through.  Despite their title, the only interest these people have in customers is to get rid of them as quickly as possible.2. Despite the recorded message saying 'Orange is committed to customer care', the responses from 'customer service agents' are always either one of ""I need to speak to someone else so I'll call you back in 5 to 10 minutes"" or mysteriously the connection is lost (presumably because they hang up on you).3. One 'customer service agent' tried to say the reason for the delay in connecting our iPhones was because our SIM cards were faulty.  When I noted his observation was not consistent with that of staff at the EE shop who supplied and fitted the SIM cards, he said he needed to check with someone in the technology team and he would ring me back in '2 to 5 minutes'.  We never heard from anyone from Orange before or after that. 4. There is a huge gap between Orange's 'official' commitment to customers is (as per pre-recorded  messages) and what their staff or agents actually provide.  The 'corporate body language' is 'once we have your money, leave us alone - we really don't care about you or your problems!'.5. Vodafone is much better staffed for handling customers in the shop -  at EE there were about 4 staff in the shop with a queue of customers in line waiting.6. Orange allow us to retain our numbers from one year to the next while Vodafone will close off a number if it is unused after 30 days - this and this alone is the only reason we are sticking with Orange (in the meantime).When we asked to speak to a manager at the EE shop to give feedback on our customer experience with Orange, we were told staff had no authority to do anything.  Our only option was to ring 'customer services' (yeah, right!) or post something on-line.  So here it is!",Jeff W,2014,4,16,1,0.046,0.042,Negative

Advice from the retentions team was to cancel and re-signup.Even more frustration was found when I went to a ""3rd party"" website and found even cheaper deals for the same contract.

233,"Big Con, Ripped off with data usage from a replacement/clone phone that hadn't been factory reset.","I have been a loyal customer of orange for 4 years. I had a problem with my previous mobile, and through insurance was sent a replacement phone. the following month got a text saying my data was close to the limit of 2GB. Now let me just explain, i use my phone for emails and phone calls - nothing else, no games, no you tube, no videos, no facebook nothing like that. I am stuck in the dark ages and don't understand modern technology or the slang that goes with it. I phoned orange to ask what this data thing was they told me it video streaming, radio, apps etc. i explained to them my small amount of knowledge, they advised me to turn off the mobile data on my phone,and contact samsung as they didn't know what was going on, so i did both, samsung told me how to factory reset which i did. The data has been fine since only using about 4MB in a month. Apparently there are 1024 MBs in a GB, my allowance was 2GB and i had used 8GB in this month after receiving the replacement phone, i thought nothing more of it until the other week when i noticed the bill on my bank statement was double the normal cost, so i phoned again to explain the dilemma, i was basically told that the data charges had been capped at £60 + VAT before this i would have been charged £5000 for going over by this much data and that it was my responsibility to check the phone settings when i received the replacement phone and that MOST of the replacement phones are sent out factory reset ( i assume i got one of the ones that wasn't factory reset). The instructions that came with the replacement phone don't state anywhere to check any kind of settings, so i just followed the instructions i had in black and white (is this not what anyone would do)They have refused flat blank to refund. Talking to them is like banging your head again a brick wall. I am so frustrated with the service, the problem, the way i have been left feeling completely conned. Just to top it all off, today i called again to discuss a refund as the more i talk to people they agree this is wrong, the floor manager told me i should have known to check the settings of the replacement phone, everyone knows this !!!!!I don't know about you but shouldn't a phone that has been used by someone else be factory reset before sending to another customer (DATA PROTECTION) The only advice i can give, is don't use orange, they are good until there is a problem, then they can't be bothered to talk to you, try and understand or try to resolve the issue.....I have seen a lot of unhappy orange customers, there is only one way that will go.....",Charlie,2014,3,24,1,0.057,0.049,Negative
234,Doesn't deserve any stars.,"I had 7 weeks of trouble with orange regarding upgrading my phone. Firstly I was told that I could upgrade in store but when I actually went to do so they tried to charge me £70. I then proceeded to upgrade via phone which all went through smoothly and was told that I would have the phone within the week. A week later I rang back to ask about the whereabouts if my phone and was told I just had to wait. Another 2 weeks later I rang again and the sales assistant told me that he didn't know what had happened to my order but would phone back. I later received a text notifying me that orange was in fact waiting on identification documents from me, one being a utility bill. As I am a student I don't have any utility bills, which I let orange know and their response in a nutshell was, there is nothing they can do. My first issue with this was why did it take me 3 weeks to find out that they wanted these documents and why did it take me phoning up? Secondly, why did they need these documents anyway. I have been with other phone companies and I've never had to provide these details when upgrading or even taking out a new contract. I phoned up again the next day about the above issues and was told I could use my passport. So, I sent the documents to the email I was given and awaited a reply. A week later I had heard nothing so I phoned up again. I was told that the email hadn't been received and was given another email address to try. I was told that I would get a reply within 2 days. 8 days later I got a reply asking for my account information. (Which I wasn't told u needed to supply) This had taken the total wait time up to 5 weeks. I then received a phone call from a 3rd party (similar to the car phone warehouse) who offered me a better deal (still with orange) and was promised the phone by the end if the week. With that I agreed to upgrade through them. They then contacted me to ask me to cancel my outgoing order with orange so they could proceed. It took me 2 phone calls to orange to do this as the first person said there was nothing on the system. The 3rd party then told me they were collecting my phone and I would have it the next day. Shortly after I was told that orange were stopping them from doing this. I then rang orange and asked to talk to a team leader to make a formal complaint. The sales associate refused. (I had already made a complaint to a sales assistant and nothing was done) I told orange that 7 weeks is not acceptable and I want orange to grant access to the 3rd party. I was told that this had been done and there shouldn't be any more issues. The next day the 3rd party phoned again reporting the same problem. I phone ld orange again to ask what was going on and they said it was a fault on their system. With this I asked to end my contract. I was told I would receive my pak code by 5pm that day. A day later and I'm still waiting. I have now taken out a new contract through the car phone warehouse and I walked out of the shop 20 mins later with a new phone. Not once did orange apologise or try to amend the situation. Absolutely disgusting service. I do not recommend them to anyone.

I explained the above, And the fact hubby been with orange for years. Then he hung up. 2nd agent said may then 2 minutes later it was june.

Soooo called customer services....hopeless, no help then cut off again...phoned back, ran through a few steps and when it did nt work, transferred to other department..cut off. This happened time and time again. Meanwhile my ofcom email had given me their reference and orange executive complaints number. They have taken on my case and hopefully will unlock phone soon (ends up my husband had taken his old tel number with him and mine didnt tie in, hence the 6 month wait, altho i still dont understand as i was paygo..no,contract) .Back to the messaging and not receiving calls.

I notified him that my dad was at work and he told me I could phone up, I've never contacted them before so I don't know what password it is. He says in an angry tone: ""We need your password or I can't help you"". I tell him I dont know what password he wants, I have 5 different combinations but I don't know what one he wants.

242,Orange™The worst customer service I have ever experienced.,"First of all, let me apologize. The following angry rant is referring to an experience I had with Orange™ France. I bought a new iPhone at an Orange™ Boutique in Paris last year. Upon payment, the sales person offered me a theft insurance policy. Seeing that I had already had my phone stolen twice, I agreed to the insurance.A year later I get my phone pickpocketed. My husband reminds me that we have a theft insurance, so I need not worry too much. I am informed at the boutique that my phone was not insured. I have receipts of the insurance. They look at it. The insurance was put on the wrong phone, an old one on the same account. When making the purchase of my new iPhone, the sales person insured another phone under the same account, instead of the phone being purchased at the time. It was clearly a mistake made on the part of Orange. The sales people at the boutique have admitted their mistake, and inform me that I have to call customer service, their number 3970, to clear it up. This call costs money, but I am put on hold for over 20 minutes on 3 different occasions. They tell me to go back to the boutique that was responsible for the original purchase, only to be told by them again to call the service line, who in turn tell me to return to the boutique, etc. There was a back-and-forth for a few weeks, when nothing got done, only to be told a month later that the theft insurance will not honor my claim.Throughout my dealings with them, I was treated with indifference at best, but mostly with annoyed uncooperation. One agent hung up on me on the ""customer service"" line after yelling at me. I am furious at the outcome and the amount of time I wasted on this mistake made by Orange™.  I feel totally cheated. They should have a theft insurance policy for the money and time they steal from their customers, but it seems that Orange™ has a very sophisticated system of avoiding valid complaints and ducking out of responsibility.",Anita Tsukizaki,2014,3,1,1,0.124,0.072,Negative

Though I have been with Orange since 2006, it would seem the company now lacks integrity, on a rapid downward spiral as it now consistently hires customer-loathing people in the world (the most inept individuals you could find that also have never heard of the world empathy) to manage their public gateway, and treat its long suffering customers with no respect. Pardon any superfluous, I am a seasoned traveller so will not succumb to errors of the genesis ( I know how to apply my phone settings whenever I leave the UK on trips abroad).  Despite buying two correct bundles for my vacation in North America and using Wifi for the greater part of my duration of 7 days, I still got landed with a £1,300 bill including £70 cost of bundles that were not even applied. These jokers also managed to delete the text message that confirmed my data usage as soon as soon as I referred to the text which was going to be my evidence to support my within data usage limit All I get are threats to pay up on the huge bill which no one in Orange can explain or wishes to discuss. By the way, though I have paid for the current period, they have also restricted my access to the disputed bill now so even more evident that these bullies know what they are doing. What is really strange is that the bill is obviously wrong on this occasion, seeming nothing has changed as per vacation destination and usage-wise so not sure why these thieves can't review the bill and admit their error. The good thing is that I have evidence of all the credit notes applied to each of the erroneous bills sent to me in the past. Trying to resolve this issue since January has been a joke and Chief Executive has read but chosen to ignore the email sent to him... (Now you understand why its CustomerService Desk sucks). Needless to say, I have requested for my PAC and I shall be raising counter claims to the county court with respect of this fake unexplanable bill.

Was calling about the issue today and had to go to the start menu twice, because they hung up on me after telling they will re-direct me to the correct department. After half an hour I was finally abl+e to get through to the right person, who said that he will get back to me after finding out what the problem was. And you think he did? ORANGE NEVER CALLS BACK, EVER IN THE HISTORY OF FOREVER.A few years ago my mom changed her contract and Orange forgot to close the previous one. She was running two contracts. We phoned them up 100 times, asking to change the details online. Orange was always apologizing, saying that they will change it straight away and never did. They also re-directed her to several departments that were of no help what so ever. Do they even know what department deals with which inquiries? Looks like the answer is NO.So my mom just stopped paying for her previous contract. And what do you know, we started receiving letters that she is overdue on her payment, and they will take legal actions if she won't pay the money. Ridiculous! We even went to the main branch in our town to look for the supervisor. Like how long does it take to update the records??? Apparently years - because we managed to sort the situation after 1.5 years! Of course, got the money back too.

Her account was showing as restricted but there was no explanation as to why.I decided to call and find out only to be met with an infuriating automated service which leads around in circles.

Shouldn’t they want to make it easier for people to pay?So unlike every other form of account in the world, Orange, EE and their subsidiaries deem us unable to deal with our own affairs without their express permission.So when she needed her phone the most she has been so utterly let down by Orange.So let’s recap1.

Of course it will be buried in terms and conditions somewhere but surely that was a key enough fact to make me aware when purchasing? Especially after explaining why and how I was using the service. And nobody has time to spend their lives reading small print, hence why they have to be fair and reasonable, or the key points notified to customers.Absolutely disgraceful.",Simon,2014,1,30,1,0.058,0.076,Positive

A message tells you to visit the website!!!!!!Decided I'm NOT going to give up on this, lots of searching and time wasting, found a number where you can get to speak to a real? person. None of the press 1 for this etc was relevant, went round in circles, made a best guess. They told me it was the wrong department. What a surprise!! They eventually put me through to another number and they just hung up on me!! So, I put a lot of money into my PAYG and got NOTHING IN RETURN (FRAUD?), wasted a LOT of time tring to get help.

Since that point things have rapidly gone downhill:The network is now dire, 3G and phonecalls dropping out all the time and incoming calls going straight to voicemail despite me having signal (according to the bars on my phone). Ironic given that EE stands for ""Everything Everywhere""...they should rename it NA, ""Nothing Anywhere"".Customer service...it's now abysmal, with hold times of at least 20 minutes on the occasions I've called (the latest being a 30 minute wait to speak to the cancellations team) only to speak with rude staff. As an example of the rudeness, my wife has also had the same problems as me and spoke with an agent to discuss cancellation of her contract on grounds of the network being so unreliable - the agent's response, ""Listen, we can talk all day but you're not getting what you want""! A simply disgusting way to treat loyal customers (my wife's been with EE/ Orange/ T-Mobile even longer than me).Such a pity, as there was a time when this company was great - seems not all mergers are good ones!

268,TOTAL AND UTTER INCOMPETENCE!!!,"I am on the dolphin pay as you go tariff and have been for a number of years now. I have never had a problem with Orange before but the last few months they have been terrible. In July 2013 I changed my BlackBerry to a Samsung, on the day that I purchased my new phone I rang Orange Customer Services to tell them that I have no longer got a Blackberry and that I would like them to deactivate my BBM service. When I rang them they were very polite and said that they have deactivated my BBM. When I topped up in August 2013 for my dolphin tariff to be renewed it came to my attention that they had taken £5.00  off my credit for my BBM service which I no longer have. I had to ring Orange Customer Service again and they had to refund me and told me to text STOP BB to 450 for it to be permanently deactivated, which I did, but the text came back saying `sorry we were unable to process your request, please try again later.` I kept trying this and the same message kept coming through. Every month they have kept taking my £5.00 off me now for 5 months, and every month I have had to ring Orange Customer Service and they kept saying the same thing either ""we have deactivated your Blackberry service, it WILL NOT happen again next month"" or ""text STOP BB to 450"". I had to explain to them again that the texting service to 450 is not in use , they even forwarded the message onto me to send to 450 and it never worked. Also some months they have refunded my £5.00 straight away, but some months they said the would refund it the next day, which they haven't, resulting in me having to ring Orange again. I have today had to ring them again for the 5th month and this has resulted in me screaming down the phone to them due to the sheer frustration that they have caused me. I demanded they put my £5.00 back onto my credit, which they have done and I have informed them that I will no longer be using Orange. Once my dolphin tariff has ended in January 2014, I will not be topping up to renew my tariff but will be using up my credit and will moving to a different network. I will not use orange again and will not recommend them to anyone.",Lauren Spencer,2013,12,23,1,0.079,0.05,Negative
269,Very poor customer relations - almost laughing at you when you are dealing with a complaint!,"I called on the 11th December to query my bill (upon advice when upgrading, I was to call Orange to check my first bill amount and confirm if I had an active direct debit in place). I spoke to Akash who confirmed everything was ok i.e. active DD in place and my first bill was the amount I expected (my price plan). This query was actually after my cut off point - you may be able to understand my disgust when double of my bill was taken out of my account via direct debit.I called on Wed 18th to speak to someone; the first person I got through to was very arrogant, trying to convince me that an 01 number was a premium number. I've just upgraded to unlimited minutes too so I couldn't understand why this was being charged. I cannot however fault a gentleman called Stanley who was very patient with me - but did confirm that landlines were not included in my last month and this switched to mobiles not being included in the next month. He understood that something needed to be looked into and offered me a call back on Thursday evening but never did - a no-no in customer services. Someone has called me back this afternoon - left a voicemail saying ""your bill is correct, please call orange with any queries"". Well a little explanation wouldn't go a miss as that's what my original query was regarding. I called and got through to a lady called Trisha - not sure what customer service training has been actioned here. For someone that works in CS, there are basic things e.g. not interrupting, being empathetic with an open mind, addressing all issues raised etc. None of this on the call. She abruptly confirmed I had gone over my minutes with little clarification. I requested a breakdown of the minutes - she said it would be £3 for a copy - a bit expensive considering my bill is so high and I'm undergoing a complaint?Even more that I had requested a call recording to be listened to - i.e. when I am asking how much my first payment is going to be, I expect a definite answer. Trisha advised me that the breakdown wouldn't have been available on the 11th when I called (until I then reiterated that the bill reset on 3rd December so it should have been available). The attitude of the staff was very defensive and not with the aim for resolution. Funny enough, the feedback questionnaire didn't come through on my phone even when I had specifically requested it?! The entire experience has been very distressing, and I dread having to call Orange again.

270,Such a fraud,"I wanted to join EE as a broadband customer and I joined and left (only after a month!!!) T-Mobile as a mobile customer due to the terrible customer service I experienced. T-Mobile subscribed me for EE broadband without my approval after ONLY calling to ask for information, therefore passing on my bank details to EE without my permission. T-Mobile overcharged me for my mobile bill and after more than a month and a large number of calls, I am still struggling to get my refund. In addition, Orange set a direct debit of £132 on my account without my permission and without being an Orange customer ever! After many calls to Orange and EE (and a pointless visit to an EE store as advised by an EE employee), I still haven't found out the reason for having a direct debit set on my account! As a result of this fraud and the lack of information, I have to close my current bank account to ensure this will not happen again in the future. Overall, the customer service has been particularly bad, making a few phone calls for each question I had as I was always misguided or passed on to     someone else in the team who was sending me back and so on...I don't normally give any negative feedback, but I find the entire experience outrageous.

It doesn't have the internet. I rang Orange to ask them if I could remove my internet bundle. They said yes, I was told it had been done there & then whilst I was on the phone. Whilst talking to the customer serive rep he told me that because I was a loyal customer that they would be happy to send me out a brand new IPhone for free. I was chuffed. I said that would be great. They said it would be with me within 10 days. It never came. I rang back & was apologised to, told they would send me out the phone & a manager would ring me to apologise too. I never received the phone or a call. (Nor did the first rep change my bundles- so the second rep did. After another wait I called back to ask what was going on. I spoke to the rudest girl, she said ""I don't see why we should send you a brand new iPhone for free"" ""it's your fault you broke it"". I was really polite (I don't like confrontation- she was a bully) I said that I'd like to speak to a manager to straighten this out. She said no. She wouldn't let me. She then said that she'd put me through to someone In the upgrade department so they could tell me exactly what she'd told me but I wouldn't listen to (her words). I was put through to someone who said they wouldn't send me one & said that no one in their company would have told me they would (basically calling me a liar). I told him I was going to make a complaint. I asked him for his name (he refused to tell me- my husband is a manger of a call centre. They have to give you their name & department so you can identify them) I explained that he had to, he made up a name, & the 3 other names of the people I spoke to. I know that because the first 2 people I spoke to were men, I tripped him up & said ""what was the 2nd girl I spoke to name? He said Alysha I asked how to spell it, he said ""how do you think?""

The guy got the nerve to ask me ""why would you want to leave sir"" in which he got a equally stupid answer back "" because you are more expensive!!""Now at this point usually it is where the provide bow out gracefully and hope I will return back to them in the future.... not with Orange....I was then informed that if i use the pac code that there will be a 30 days charge.

295,"Stay away form them, they are the worst company ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I am writing this review and at the same time I am talking to Orange customer service. I have never ever been let down so badly. On Thursday I thought I will give orange a try. Gone to Argos got myself a PAYG SIM done a £10.00 top up and called Orange to transfer my number. 1GB free data seemed like a good thing. So I called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do. Was promised that my number will be ported over on Friday before midnight. I was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred. Come today morning nothing happened. Still no porting. So I called Orange (25p each call to customer service!)And asked what is going on. Long story short the person I spoke to told me I was given a BULK PAC CODE (no such a thing!!!)And it will be done on Tuesday. I did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done. The person I was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me, I asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor. The reply was “I CAN TALK OVER YOU AND CUSTOMER IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT”! I demanded to speak to her supervisor and she than told me that there is no supervisors working today!!!Impossible! She than cut me off. What a S!!!! service, I called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer service person has cut me off. 3rd call now and I am speaking to a supervisor. Actually he has just put me on hold and I have been holding for 30 minutes. I told him that I want to make an official complaint about him and his service and that I am not happy, I want to stop the porting. He has put me on hold and I know he is just waiting for me to disconnect the call. Well I am on my way to Orange shop now and let’s get this sorted there. NEVER USE ORANGE NEVER ! I will tell all my friend not to trust them even if the give you free calls for life. What a disappointment.

Doing this really did not help as it said i couldn't even control my phone on itunes. further on waiting until 10pm i then put my sim in and it still came up with the same message. The following day arrived and still no call, therefore we waited the day later, and still no call. Therefore i have just called up and a total airhead answered not giving me anymore information on when my phone will be unlocked and then she refereed me to the 'ceo' which was obviously a false line because for 5 minutes there was no talking from the other end. Calling back another total airhead answered and was still no help.NOW BECAUSE OF ALL OF THIS:i am talking all of my 4 children off their orange sims. i am cancelling my new orange contract which will cost £702.94 but this is the price i am willing to pay to get off this company! i am also informing all of my friends & family ect about their appalling surface.i just hope that no one else's teenage daughter will receive a phone which they arnt able to use for their birthday and especially 2 months after.",Izz Hall,2013,10,17,1,0.07,0.051,Negative

I was then cut off...I called again and went through the system - this time to add services. This time I got an answer.. Wow - they are so interested in new customers and more money they are to busy to retain existing customers.The good news is that when I did get to talk to someone they refunded all the extra insurance I had paid and added 8%.

318,"Warning-PORT your # from ORANGE;lose your Online access to your account, immediately","I have/had a Monthly Orange Mobile phone account for 2 years. As I don't use my phone much, except when I am on holiday, I decided to move to GiffGaff as this was much more flexible for my occasional greater use.Although I had trouble contacting Orange Customer Service (seems even worse since they became EE), I managed to find a direct number to a very nice man who gave me my porting PAC number etc. All went smoothly, and number ported to GiffGaff.I then tried to logon to my Orange account to see what I still owed and download past statements. No go. Tried to contact Customer Services and after eons waiting thought I would try the Orange Helpers on Facebook. Seems a bit dodgy security wise, but slow yet good communication ensued. Seems that once your number has been ported you can no longer log onto your account. Strange as number still unique to Orange systems! So how do I download my old statements? Cannot be done and they will not send them by email, but they will post them to you for £3.60 + Vat; for 12 months worth that is £40 plus!So I thought I would go through the complaints procedure and eventually spoke to a man on 0800 0790134. He said the account was linked to the phone number so I could not look at my account. Fine, but I said that the phone number was still unique to Orange, so why should that be a problem, also that I still had an account with Orange as they had not sent me a final bill or processed my last Direct Debit. REPEATEDLY HE WOULD NOT ADMITT THAT THE ORANGE ONLINE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM could not cope with this. Why not admit the obvious! When I asked what was the next step in the complaints procedure he said there wasn't one, because he had given me an ""end of the line"" answer.This is only the most recent problem I've had with Orange over the 2 years with them, I won't be going back to Orange or EE and will be moving my Orange PAYG when it runs out.",Petrol Han,2013,7,23,1,0.076,0.084,Positive
319,Don't they teach their customer service reps anything?,"I received a new SIM card for my phone. I followed the instructions to activate the card, but there was some kind of error. I did this using a landline phone since my mobile phone did not work. I then tried online, but I also got a message about some kind of error.I finally called, using my business mobile phone, and kept getting their business support. I did ask for someone that was not business support, but I was told they can help me. At first my first four calls were dropped, so I had to go through the process of explaining the error five times. I finally had a good connection and someone who tried to help me, but it was obvious she had no clue what was going on. She kept insisting that a phone number should have come with the SIM card. I explained there was no phone number and the only number there was was the SIM card number.This went on with this girl, insisting she needed a phone number which should have come with the card until. I then started to ask to speak to a manager. She insisted she could help me and there was no need to speak to a manager. I asked this at least three time. Finally, out of my frustration, I called her an idiot and hung up.I called again and finally I got someone who seemed to be a tech person. He didn't have much of a clue why I kept getting the error messages, but after talking to his colleague, finally told me to just put the SIM card in my phone and wait two hours and it will be working. After 24 hours it still was not working. I guess he also did not have a clue. For that matter I got the impression he was in the wrong job.The next day I called the Orange's sales number and talked to a sales rep. I told him about the error problem with my new SIM card. He asked for the SIM card number, notice it was not registered on my account, to my phone number, then asked for the SIM card number. He entered it and told me to wait 2 hours. When I got home I turned on my phone and surprise surprise! It was working. Gee, either Orange has a bad training systems, or they've scrapped the bottom of the barrel for two of the worst humans to work for them.Maybe Orange should stop being cheap and hire people with some level of intelligence, AND this should start from the TOP!",Miguel Nieto,2013,7,17,1,0.122,0.107,Negative

A guy spent 30 mins offering me ridiculous deals but i just want out. Told them i was switching networks and for them just to cancel it right now. He turned to say the system is down and cannot cancel it tonight and told me to ring first thing in the morning! Why didn't he say that before wasting my time? ,,,,,,,,

329,Worst Customer Service Ever!,"This company doesn't even deserve any stars if it was up to me. Was cancelling contracts a month ago, telling them I was going to GiffGaff/ Tesco Mobile for sim only - £10 per month for 2GB internet, 500 minutes and unlimited/ 5000 texts. We were then told they could in fact not only match the deal but beat it all for just £11! (We thought this was brilliant!) However, as the time passed, we were sent a letter 4 days before we were due to start this new contract which had 2.5GB internet, 1000 minutes and unlimited texts. It turned out that in fact we were only to receive 250MB per month. We then rang up with this problem and asked them to check if they made a mistake. INFACT they do not sell any product giving 2.5GB of internet and we asked them to check the phone call we had made to upgrade to this product I had wanted - We were told they would ring 24 hours later - They decided it was a good idea to ring at 10PM!!! This is totally ridiculous on it's own. On the message I got after being asleep with the phone off, they said they'd ring back between 1:30pm - 3:30pm. This didn't happen. So we rang them. We were cut off with this problem 3 TIMES! - To make sure it wasn't the phones fault. All 3 contracts we had - so 3 phones (iPhone 4S + Blackberry Curve x 2) rang up... ALL WERE CUT OFF MID CONVERSATION!!! This was on Fri 14th June 2013!!! These new contracts start tonight at 12:00AM... So from being told multiple times we would be called back. We haven't been contacted at all!So we will not be going back with Orange in the future after cancelling payments the next day! I hope this helps with people who may also be experiencing (Sorry for the language but I feel this is relevant) this BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!Obviously we are going to let Orange know. And im going to name names in this perdicament as this has been totally unfair seeming the only way I can contact them is via phone call! People involved were: Ray Crowley (Manager/ Supervisor @ Orange Customer Service)Others were involved in this and we are very infuriated with this problem we've had. As I know, all calls are recorded so if you'd like to check them then this would be BRILLIANT! Maybe some retraining or firing is in order?

I then rang orange following that bill they explained that actually the minutes had ran over..Next month another extortionate bill, of course this meant another 40mins-1hour on the phone on hold and explaining my issue, (being recommended this tariff by orange based on previous usage) i eventually managed to get orange to accept liability for the wrong/misleading information and they agreed to up my minutes to 500 free of charge..Since then there have been several more phone calls with me taking names and extensions of operators in the hope they will relay some information if needed. I'm still being overcharged. One operator who left me his name told me he can understand exactly why i'm so frustrated with orange. He explained that when orange upped my minutes, they stopped my texts? WITHOUT me knowing?This is the new reason for high bills. he spoke with his supervisor and they between them agreed to give me unltd calls to all networks + unltd texts to all networks + U24 package which would come into effect June 8th 2013. He also said he would credit the account £120 after admitting liability for the mistake which again was down to orange and he stressed NOT ME!The latest bill came through as another high bill, after being told I'm in credit £120 the last thing i expect is any bill at all..(orange owe me money at this point remember).31st May, I made another long winded by this point very annoying call to orange where YET AGAIN i have to explain everything in the outset. No operator is aware of changes made to accounts or issues. Do orange even have internal communication or do they just put a post-it on their screen? This operator agreed i shouldn't have even been billed and sent the bill for questioning for me with the assurance of a call back in 48Hrs max to resolve this ever ongiong waste of time and headache. they called back about 4-5 days later and left a voice mail saying..(i'll cut it down) ""bill was correct"".Wed 12th June Tariff still hasn't changed as promised. I called orange AGAIN they say now i haven''t been credited £120 and the tariff hasn't been changed. Eventually after being asked to explain my situation TO A DIFFERENT OPERATOR, the operator hung up on me after nearly 40 mins on the phone.

My husband works in IT and my son is very savvy with mobile phones but neither of them could get this swapable to work.  We phoned Orange and where promised a call back - they never did.

I am told it was the fee for the replacement phone, so i have to battle for three months and numerous calls to get the issue sorted, I can't wait for my contract to end so I can tell them where to stick their Orange wednesdays!!!",Jo Jordan,2013,4,18,2,0.107,0.033,Negative
344,ORANGE WILL CHARGE YOU FOR USAGE EVEN WHEN YOUR PHONE & SIM GETS STOLEN AND THEY 'BLOCK' IT!!,"ORANGE WILL CHARGE YOU FOR USAGE EVEN WHEN YOUR PHONE & SIM GETS STOLEN AND THEY 'BLOCK' IT!!After my phone got pickpocketed, I received the worst customer service from Orange. I actually called them from Greater Manchester Police HQ (I still have a crime number and it's on their records) and the woman over the phone *actually* said I could have been lying about having my phone stolen, and the fact I had no insurance meant there were no goodwill gestures whatsoever. They promised that they would blocked my phone so no-one else could use it...and yet over the course of a year (2010-2011), after complaining and refusing to pay my bills for a phone I did not have and a SIM I did not have, they charged me over £800 in total for a service that I never used. They threatened my with letters, bailiffs and that I was even breaking the law!Orange made me feel vulnerable and stupid, and that I had no choice but to pay it. And so I did. If anyone can help me with how to complain to an ombudsman, that would be great, but I fear I'd have no rights as they are EE now and not Orange.I've been too scared to write this before, but now I'm not, because I want to take action: Orange completely ruined me and overcharged nearly every month. I was with them for years. There is no sense of loyalty to customers who are loyal to them. I think that speaks volumes too.Don't EVER go for Orange, or EE (same villain, different clothes). They do not give two hoots about you. I cannot wait to switch to another provider. Total moneygrabbers. My experience has shown they don't care about their customers, seems more like they only care about their bribery of cinema chains.

345,Shocking Terrible Service - Orange broadband,"I've been with Orange for many years. The broadband speed is not great but I can live with it. This January, I switched my broadband from Orange to Talktalk because Orange didn't provide static WAN IP address. The switching went well, my Talktalk broadband connected on time, no problem, internet speed is faster. BUT, I have nightmare with Orange. I called Orange for Mac code before I switched, Talktalk told me they don't need to use the Mac code anyway.In February, I noticed Orange is still taking money from my account. I called Orange, being told that it's typical Talktalk's fault not using the Mac code, as a result my account is still opened. Orange said my account will be closed after 10 days. Guess, until now, April, my Orange account is still opened, Orange is still continuing taking money from me. I called them again, their customer service said:'Oh, I don't know why you are still charged'---&gt; Be aware, they don't know what they are doing!!!! It causes so much stress and taking time & money to call Orange, because Orange closed their customer service's email. I guess is they probably received too many complaints.I've sent them a complaint letter, no reply. I haven't received my refund payment.  Unbelievable shocking service.

346,getting worse....,"Orange provided the best service for the area in which I live - a village in a hollow! The good service went downhill last year and just gets worse. Today at work I can't access the internet as the ""Web page not available"" message keeps coming up. Yesterday there was no problem. There is no point going to the EE store as they don't care. Their attitude is they just sell the phones, and they can't check the mobile as they have signal boost. So why have the shops?A short while ago I had next to zero service at home. Repeated calls to Customer Services only served to raise my temper. 'Have you switched the phone off and on again' etc etc.. Eventually I hung up. After another few day's lack of service, I found a helpful person on Customer Service. He knew that the company was working on a local mast - no one else appeared to know this at Customer Services the other times I had called - and that my service would be significantly impacted for about 2 more weeks. Advice and discount given. A rare experience for me indeed.Standard customer service revolves around 'have you switched the mobile off and on again', 'take the battery out' etc etc. Useless. Find that helpful person and get him to train the others. If Orange is to work on masts and deprive me of their network then tell me in advance. It appears EE are more interested in 4G than the rest of us.It's 2013 and I should be able to access 3G wherever I live - provided I'm not on some remote spot of the country.I will be having a really good look around when my contract comes up for renewal.

It's the same old story, account manager gets the sale of 80+ connections with us and then doesn't give a damn. The frontline customer service staff are nice but even the process of getting things from Orange is a nightmare. They have an email address you can request things from but it takes 3-4 days before they respond and another 2-3 days before they deliver even though our company is in a large metropolitan town. How can a company be so bad and not give a damn. We've had major issues with the performance of their network across the UK, in areas like London where you would think it would be pretty good. I think the rollout of 4G means they have taken their eye off the ball in terms of getting the customer service right in the first place. We have had a problem with their network for the last 4 months at a particular location and it's hard to believe they can't get it resolved after all this time. They may be the biggest network in the UK but they certainly aren't the best.Wish I'd now gone to Vodafone or stuck with O2, at least with O2 the service was quick and efficient and the coverage was pretty good all over.Stay well clear of Orange they have totally lost the plot!

She is speechless and after talking to her manager she goes we can end your contract. I goes what the hell? I was with orange from last 5 years and is that what you treating to your customer. She said nothing she could do but the end of the contract and return back my handset.

She goes contact termination usually cost 180 pound but we offer you free. I said you want to end my contract I just asked you to rectify the network problem but because you can't do anything you offered the contract termination.

352,Such poor quality service,"THIS WAS STILL REJECTED... EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!My claim for a new phone (6 months old)  was rejected due to me not contacting them within the 7 days. This was my letter explaining my circumstances! This letter and my appeal was then again rejected. When asking to speak to a manager  i was told 'he cant help you' and then left on hold for 20 minutes. I also said another compnay would buy out my contract after 5 or so year of being with Orange, they replied 'OK do it'. I feel this is an absolutly unacceptable way to deal with loyal customers, and i expected better. I would like to appeal against your decision to reject my claim for mitigating reasons.My first and foremost, the main reason i did not make a claim immediately was due to the fact i was travelling, and there was no suitable time for delivery, i thought it didn't make sense to order a phone when i had no clear date for delivery. I was unaware of the time scale for making a claim, as i do not have a paper copy of my contract to refer back to, as i normally renew my contract over the phone.I was also confused by the time scale as the last time i made a claim it was after 7 days, I was also unaware that the circumstances change when you are abroad, therefor knowing i had done it before, i did not see why waiting to make the claim was an issue.It is upsetting also that this handset and previous claim was made a mere six months ago and the handset is already unusable. I would particularly like to fight my case here as on February the 14th, i did in fact go into an EE store (Westmorland Shopping Centre in Kendal) and discuss with a female member of staff my best options for replacing the phone, whether this be through Orange Care, or under Samsung warranty (as i have only had the handset six months, this was still an option) I was advised, which ever option i chose i would have to pay the same fee, and it would be quicker and more direct to claim through Orange insurance. At this point i do feel very strongly that it the clauses of the contact were repeated and i was made sure i was aware and told that i had to claim within seven days. If this had been the case i would have made the claim there and then in the shop. I do feel that is is important for staff to be knowledgeable on company policies to help consumers like me in these situations. If the staff are not aware then this critical information can not be passed onto customers. Although this was not logged onto a computer, i was given a new, full battery so as i could use my mobile phone, this information will hopefully correspond to the battery originally sent out with my phone, to back me up.I do feel with all this in place, that it is slightly unfair to have rejected my claim, and i am quite happy to pay the access fee for a new one. I have been an Orange customer for the past five years, as has my father. We both rack up rather large bills at times and i also have Orange home broadband with you. I have paid for insurance ever since i took my first contract out with Orange, and me and my family have shown a large amount of loyalty to your company. In return i do not feel i have been given the service quality i pay for, and with that much dedication, i feel there should have been some leeway in my claim. My father was very unhappy with the decision, and complained to Orange stating he would be happy to change network, the reply from an Orange team member was 'thats fine, ok,' I don't feel this is the customer service or loyalty by the company we deserve for networking with Orange all these years.I hope you can understand why i am disappointed within the company and service, and prove these acceptable reasons for not making a claim sooner, and allow me to order a new handset.Many Thanks",Lola Bellouere,2013,3,25,1,0.081,0.085,Positive

Basically, the phone number on the message it sent me as the mobile number  started with 44 not the uk 07 and somehow this has caused a glitch on their system - they acknowledged it was their fault but it has taken an enormous amount of time to sort this out - and still actually not! Passed from one call centre staff member to another listening to lengthy 'option' lists at the end of which you sometimes get cut off or told to dial another number. FRUSTRATING beyond words,  I also have a Tesco mobile and when I had a problem with that it was one phone call to an English call centre where they immediately understood what I was talking about and sorted it at no cost to me.  The Indian call centre staff ARE polite but it is huge mistake to think any money is being saved when simple queries take multiple calls to sort out because of difficulties with the finer points of language and rather strong accents.

Then your going to love waiting 95% of the time you're on the phone, listening to all the not classics, while you feel your credit and life slip away. Also if you got the orange care, then make sure you cancel that too, or you can expect the fiery spiked dick of satan to play more ear rape while you call back to cancel that little gem too. That is if you manage to navigate the most asinine bullshit of a dial system. I mean i love it when i have to dial my phone number and password (oh yeah it expects you to type letters with your phone, so if like me you don't own the latest idick, then you get to chow down on arse pavlova), so i get put through to someone who doesn't speak my language and ask for the same details again, but you might think different. You know if you unlike orange were gifted with a brain cellAs the title suggest, i believe i honestly would rather play twister in a minefield.

I have been over charged by at least £100 on several occassions. The way they get around this is by when you phone up to get help two problems occur. first of all it's an 08- number so you are charged. second of all they put on some rude prick at the end of the phone who doesn't have the slightest clue about how to speak english. Even worse is when you go into an orange store or ""EE"" now they just tell you that it has to be sorted out over the phone.So currently I have paid about £500-1000 because of charging me for calls that I havent made, internet I haven't used etc. I changed my nice smart phone to a shitty button phone so I didn't use the internet and I could lock my phone easily. yet they still charged me more money per month.So for the last two months, I didnt have a phone, okay I'll pay for the contract straight, can't charge me for not using a phone right? WRONG, an extra £6.55 was added, doesn't even say anywhere in the statement as to why. And obviously I tried phoning them up again. but not being racist but in the most indian accent ever.

358,Atrocious service - it doesn't come any worse,"I had a four-phone contract with Orange for about five years.  Over the last two years I have been totally and utterly disgusted with their customer service. I would urge people to think vary carefully before becoming a customer.  Here is a summary of the issues I experienced.From a basic perspective, when you call them there is almost always a recorded message saying they experiencing a high rate of calls so there will be a wait – on average I’d say 10-15 minutes. It seems to me that they need to recruit some more people or sort out their operations. I needed to get my phone hived off from the other three phones in my family, onto a separate account.  To cut a very long story short, but which involved countless phone calls and assurances of action, this still hadn’t happened after six months. The way they dealt with my request was a complete and utter shambles to the point that they were next to useless.  I was given incorrect information, assurances the request was being dealt with but every time I chased I was told something different.  To add insult to injury, I used the email-to-complain facility from their website twice – about six months apart, and on both occasions the email was returned with an automated message saying the system was being upgraded and so was not functioning – so annoying when after exhausting myself trying to talk to these people and then spend 20 minutes writing a note only for it to swallowed up and disappear into their shambles of an operation.  The joke of it is that when you ring the recoded message trumpets about 'Orange being committed to the best possible service'.  It is a joke, and complete and utter bull---t. I have since left Orange and will never go back. Be warned!",Tony P ,2013,3,9,1,0.092,0.067,Negative

Rang again (1hr 30 mins and 5 different advisors) eventually I was told that there'd been an error and the broadband hadn't been flagged up for transfer so I'd have to wait another 5 to 10 working days.  That was it, I told them I wanted to cancel and was eventually put through to the cancellations department where I was told I'd have to pay a £20 cancellation fee as I was still on contract whilst I didn't want to pay anything I agreed just so I could move on.  2 months later and I'm still getting billed and am told I must ring or write to them to cancel (email is unacceptable).

361,WENT DOWN HILL RAPIDLY!,"Having been a satisfied customer of orange for many years, I moved my landline and broadband to them - big mistake!!  To cut a long story short I was left with no phone or broadband for around 2 weeks while orange blamed BT for the problem stating the line was down before they took it over and doing very little to resolve the situation. I had various problems with routers resulting in endless calls to India, speaking to people who could barely speak the language never mind help with technical issues. When my phone contract was up moved to another provider but orange failed to cancel contract, eventually got it cleared up and told account was finally closed and charges sorted only to receive letter form debt collector several months later. Every time I phone orange they agree no money due but I still receive letters and phonecalls from debt collection agency. It is not possible to speak to anyone in a UK call centre and I have been going round in circles for 6 months now. Now landline contract is up I have moved to another provider and despite them having provided the new service for around 3 - 4 weeks orange continue to take direct debit.

I checked today on the status of my request to be told that there was no such record. AARRGHH. I also tried to email their customer service department. Nice and easy I thought but only to get a reply that they are changing their email system and that the message I sent wouldn't be actioned. How can a global company not have email ?Absolutley shocking customer service. Great if it just works but god help anyone who needs something sorting. Apparently according to the info on this post orange will be informed of their rubbish customer service. Good luck with that, I don't think they have an email system yet, after all it's only 2013 or is it 1963?",Matt Driver,2013,1,28,2,0.063,0.123,Positive
367,"Alright When Things Go Right, But When They Do Wrong Watch Out!",After 4 phone calls and a letter of complaint I am still no further forward in gaining full access to my online Orange account because of a technical glitch that asks me to contact the person who manages the account so I can upgrade - which is me!

368,A company that doesn't really know what they are doing.....,"Have been an Orange internet user since the freeserve days!Spoke to Orange at the beginning of November to enquire about the prices of their new fibre packages.  Couldn't get any decent deal so decided to stick to my current non-fibre package.  Middle of December, noticed a message on my online account saying ""an order was being processed"".  Phoned Orange around the end of December to enquire what this was, only to find out that they had started to process a fibre order from my call in November - even though I didn't want it.  They admit a mistake, since the order hadn't been placed properly.  Unfortunately I used this opportunity to enquire again about prices but, since still not a good deal, declined and was told the erroneous order would be cancelled.Today, noticed a bill for over £100 on my account - phoned Orange, they are still progressing an Orange fibre order and have no record of my trying to cancel at the end of December!  Have now had a ""miss-sell"" case raised (even though I wasn't actually miss-sold, since I didn't agree to go ahead!) and am waiting a call back from the miss-selling team, which I'm told could be around two weeks.  Everytime I call Orange, the automated message tells me that they are currently ""extremely busy"" and I ""might have to wait a long time"".  How true....This confirms everything I know about Orange.  They are O.K when things are going well.  If you need to contact them, you might experience problems.",Ian King,2013,1,7,2,0.101,0.023,Negative
369,Terrible Experience,"Phew! Am I relieved to have finally come out of my Orange phone contract. I have been with 4 mobile phone companies and Orange has been the worst. When I took out my contract with Orange I had technical issues with my phone. I found myslef calling their Customer Service team on a monthly basis as my main problem was the contacts and mailbox never synchronised. The average call last approximately 2hrs and they won't call you back. The staff don't really understand English and the ones that do, certainly don't have customer service in mind.I was tied into a 18mth contract. After a year of technical issues, very bad network coverage and problems with connecting to the internet. I requested to be released from the contract. I was so kindly told by a manager that the contract between Orange and the Customer is only to provide calls and text messages. As long as I can receive and make those, Orange was not in breach of the contract.I am still annoyed about wasting money on an ""upgrade"" for additional phone features only to spend hours on the phone to their call centres and achieve nothing. I'm now free from their terrible services and have cancelled both my broadband and company contracts. I have also since discovered that there not many people on Orange; only a fair few who have bought their pay and go sim card for 241 at the cinema.",Kayls,2013,1,4,1,0.112,0.045,Negative
370,Orange Owe Me! Rubbish Customer Service!,I ordered an iPhone 5 online with this company back in September and had to pay £50 deposit which would come off my 4th bill. I cancelled the contract after a week after Orange said they did not know when i'd receive the phone and i would get my £50 back within a month. A month had past and still no refund! After spending 2 hours on the phone getting transferred from one department to the next the phone went dead (lines had closed) Ring again the following day and was told i would receive my refund in 10 days. 10 days later and still nothing!  Rang again and told yet again 10 days. It's not the end of December and i still have not had a refund. Who do they think they are? If i owed them money they would soon be on my back for it! I have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening legal action! Like i have nothing better to do with my time that writing letters to them asking for MY money back. Will never go with Orange in the future!,Christopher Lloyd-jones,2012,12,30,1,0.09,0.021,Negative
371,"Absolute rubbish, so bad I have decided to leave and I'm taking all my friends with me.","I have been with orange since the early 1990's and loyally resisted the offers of other networks during all that time.I lost my job in late September and decided that as I was no longer using my phone at work, and the 2 year contract was up, I would call orange to try and cut down on my £50 per month average mobile bill (looking back I was paying double what I could get from other networks).  I asked what was the best they could do for me while I was out of work and just getting job seekers allowance. They said as I only used about 500 mins per month I should go on a SIM only package 600 mins for £26 per month. I said that was the absolute most I could afford on my unemployment money.  ""This would be ideal for you"" I was told. Unlimited texts and 500 Mb internetWell the first bill came at the expected £26. Then the November bill came in at a staggering £177!!  When I called to ask why, I was told that someone would get back to me within 24hrs. When they didn't call back in the promised time. I called again. I was told that there had been an error and I had been billed for inclusive minutes, they would re-calculate and call me back within 48hrs. Still no call back so I called back after 3 days and was told ""You don't have any magic numbers on your account as it is a SIM only contract so all calls come out of inclusive minutes”.(Magic numbers are orange numbers that you nominate and calls to those numbers are free. You earn more magic numbers the longer you stay with orange. I had up to 12 available including friends and family members). They also said I had gone over my 600 mins and used 830-850 mins (can't remember exact number but was in that range)I said that there was no mention of losing magic numbers on a SIM only contract when I was advised to go on this package. They said as a 'goodwill gesture' they would credit me with £30! Big Deal!!!I said not interested. I had been mis sold the package and I would have been better off staying on my original £50 per month package. They need to sort it out. Am I missing something if I understand a SIM only contract means that I am paying for the same as a normal contract except for the phone itself which I have paid for over the last two years in my monthly bills?After a total of 8 or 9 calls where orange failed to call back every single time without fail. I received a call on my landline from the collections team asking if I wanted to pay the outstanding bill. I told them I was still awaiting the outcome from a promised 48hr return call going back to about a week before Christmas.(it' was now dec28th).I was passed on to a lady who although very pleasant and helpful and actually spoke very good English (unlike some of the previous ones who had difficulty understanding basic English and spent half the call repeating everything that was said), she was still unable to sort it out to a satisfactory conclusion.She also told me that in November I had used over 930 minutes (that figure has changed from the previous 830-850)The latest is that the bill is now up to £210 including £36 December bill. They have offered to credit my account with £100 leaving me to pay £110 (remember I was told that I would be best on a £26 per month package. I said it's not good enough as I cannot afford to pay £110 out of a total of £142 which is my fortnightly Job seekers money. It would leave me £32 to last 2 weeks. The lady then offered to change the SIM only contract to 1000 mins, unlimited texts and 250Mb for £26. She wouldn't put me through to disconnections (customer retention) as I still had an outstanding bill. I won't be cut off yet though as she has tagged my account as such. The unfortunate thing is all my job seeking letters, agencies and CV's I have sent out have my phone details which is not going to look good when I have to contact them and advise of a new number.I am very angry at orange for the service and lies they have fed me. My family are all ready to change over to another network; some of my friends have also got the arse with orange and have already gone to 3. There are a whole group of us going to do the same soon. For £26 on 3 I can get 2000mins + 5000 3to3 mins, unlimited texts and sh*t loads of data. It's a no brainer.

I changed to o2 and wow what great service 100% throughout !I have just experienced the worst customer service you could ever imagine!How does some company ( orange ) remove nearly three times the monthly charge amount from your bank account for a cock up they made and admitted to and then say we won`t refund you but keep the money instead and use it to pay off your orange bill in the near future ?Along with swopping my tariffs over and changing my password without my even knowing ?This is exactly what orange have just done to me so if let`s say they take most of your wages from you because of a mistake orange made then that will leave you completely skint all over xmas because they WON`T give it you back because of there  terrible ( **** ) company policy !Surely there must be a law about taking money from your own account by mistake and not returning it ?If it`s not a rubbish orange signal it`s awful customer service and taking your money because of a serious mistake by orange and then NOT giving you it back is disgusting in all area`s !You have been warned as this is a 100% true incident which happened to me on the 26/11/2012 ...The simple solution to avoid rubbish customer service and having money removed from your bank account and then not returned is to NOT JOIN ORANGE !!!!!As for EE  ha yeah right ! lmao more like NN ... naff all nowhere!",Laurence Harvey,2012,12,2,1,0.145,0.077,Negative
373,Disgusted!,"I am putting in a strongly felt complaint about the way I have been treated as a long standing customer. I have been with EE (formally Orange) for five-six years and my whole family are on the network too, meaning another four customers being with you a similar number of years. But with the problems I have recently had with my Blackberry Bold 9080 I have found that my loyalty to stay with your network for such a long period doesn't seem to be noticed.	The problem I am having is that my Blackberry is showing on the screen I have full strength signal but I won't receive anything for hours until I try to send a SMS message or call someone to find that the message/call fails which then leads to me doing a battery pull and a huge cluster of messages come through but for out going calls its still only on the 3rd or 4th attempt that the call actually goes through.	I have spent numerous hours on the phone to EE to try resolve the problem and have had to wait over a number of days for different diagnostic tests to be run and from all that they couldn't even give me a result. So I then got passed onto Blackberry Helpline who I have been on the phone to for 3 hours tonight, to now do another 24 hour test on the phone.	This whole situation is becoming ridiculous and could be dangerous to me. I am a student living away from home; so for one my mobile phone is my only resource in an emergency. Then even worse when I mentioned to a lady on the EE helpline, that if something happened whilst I'm out, EE seem to find it reasonable for me to have to do a battery pull on my phone to then be able to contact someone and to me that is not acceptable. Another reason I mention this is because I use my Blackberry for work and these problems have meant I have missed important meetings therefore causing me more problems in other areas.	This isn't the first time I have had a problem with Orange/EE and Blackberry's. I have previously had the curve and had to change that handset at least 4 times and this is the 4th time I have had a problem with the Blackberry Bold. When I went into store to ask about this problem, the gentlemen that served me said that seen as it was the 4th time I have had a problem with the handset it meant that I could receive a complementary upgrade of sorts. But then when I rang up EE they then said that wasn't the case and to upgrade I would have to pay off the outstanding cost on my contract. So I have been told completely opposing statements and it has given me even more reason to think about moving to another network when my contract comes to an end, which for me was the last resort but at the moment seems like I have no other option.	Finally I am disappointed in the way EE have acted over my problem, thinking it would have been a simple upgrade -as I had been told in store. But seen as that is now not the case I am left without a phone and feel completely discarded by EE.",Maddie Levis,2012,11,15,1,0.119,0.052,Negative
374,Unacceptable level of customer service,"Following numerous attempts to try and resolve a combination of errors and problems on my Orange account, 4 months on I continue to talk to operators who do not know what they are doing or how to resolve the matter.  Recorded correspondence has been sent to Orange Customer Service, to the address detailed on their website, yet to date they have chosen to ignore this with the 8 week response period expiring.Having made the mistake of extending my contract with Orange following an extensive sales pitch, of what I now know to be utter lies, I am confident in suggesting that you are better off using an alternative service provider.  Whilst I cannot guarantee a smooth ride with a competitor, I can assure you that the level of customer service will go far and beyond the level that Orange operate at.  Please be assured that I am not marking Orange at 1* because I want something out of this.  I do not believe in demanding 'compensation' based on a poor experience, however I do believe that when a contract is signed a company has a responsibility to adhere to the customer service statement.My suggestion to Orange - stop wasting money on annoying and poorly executed cinema commercials and direct this budget, or at least a portion, into staff training and maintaining existing customers.  Alternatively, if you insist on steering customers to your website improve this along with your mobile app so that it can handle the level of traffic required.",Paul,2012,11,1,1,0.096,0.097,Positive

402,I've been a loyal customer for years but now feel massively let down.,"Home Broadband - I have had so many issues it’s impossible to write them all down, but they include re-arranged connection dates, engineers not arriving on days promised even after taking days off of work, a total of nearly 12 hours on the phone to customer services being passed from person to person and answering the same questions, promised call backs that never happen and E-mails that go un answered. I still have on going speed problems that are not solved. Because of this I have decided to leave Orange home phone and Orange broadband as I can’t waste any more time. Mobile contract – It’s unfortunate that the home my partner and I have moved to doesn’t have Orange or T-mobile signal. However, I was told many times by customer services that it should be. I wanted to leave our contracts as a phone with no signal at home is useless, but was horrified to hear we would have to pay the rest of our contract to be allowed out. Finally, after hours of calls, I had a break through yesterday, speaking to Kevin in the iPhone support team who told me that I am in what is called “An Optimisation” area, and without doubt myself and my partner would be allowed out of our Orange contracts as we are in a black spot where you are turning transmitters off. He later phoned back to say it was all sorted and put me though to disconnections. After a 27 minute wait on hold, disconnections answered and had no notes of his promise, another 17 minutes on hold and I was told they would call back in 24 hrs, of course, with previous experience of Orange I knew this wouldn’t happen, and it didn’t.  In clause 4 of the terms and conditions it does say that I can cancel the contract early if Orange cannot provide the service, whether it’s within your control or not – Ofcom have very clear rules on this too.

405,Useless and Impossible,I recently switched our family allegiance from o2 to orange to save around £5 a month.  Was it worth it ........... NO!,,,,,,,,
In 14 days I have more reasons to call customer services than in 10 years with O2.,,,,,,,,,,
The systems are useless - Services which are supposed to be inclusive keep stopping and ask for payment.  The online service keeps saying phone numbers / accounts are wrong when they are not.  Pin numbers disappear.  Then 2 mins later its all back working.,,,,,,,,,,
Then the final straw is when you try to rectify an issue and it is impossible to get to speak to anyone that understands. The automated phone menus assume that you do not have a complaint and make impossible to reach a person.   If you are lucky enough to get in a queue they then tell you it is busy and that you must wait at least an hour.,,,,,,,,,,

I spoke to Customer Services again, this time they put me through to tech supoort they told me that my postcode was in a void and it wasnt the handset that was faulty.

I have complained to them until Im blue(not orange!) in the face. The speeds I was getting were as slow as 0.67 and 0.70 bps. Every time I complained the Indian technical staff kept telling me that my telephone was at fault. Nothing was faulty according to Orange at their end. I changed from Orange to Virgin and Im pleased to see my internet speed is now nearly 10.0!! What a difference and I can now watch films that I could never do with Orange!Having recently moved to Virgin, I thought that I would return to Orange via my new ISP Virgin and guess what, Orange is as slow with Virgin!!!!  I didnt do a speed check but I would say Orange was no different and their speed is between 0.60 and 1.00!!!  How on earth can they allow such a poor service while trying to blame every one except themselfs.Virgin is not without its faults but is nowhere near as bad as Orange and its certainly much much quicker!An Ex Orange Internet Customer.....3 Months on and I am delighted with Virgin, great service, excellent deals if you shop around and they offer a lot of hidden extras that are FREE!!!  Like free anti virus software, telephone helplines that are in the UK!

I did get a telephone call from Orange and some young guy was so obnoxious and he could not understand why I had left and when I told him the above his reply was are you still in the cooling off period!

I don't know what mail service Orange used but I don't know of any company that takes more than 20days from dispatch date. Avoid this joke of a company at all costs.

After assembling my old phone I tried to use my credit. This did not work through the automated service so I called an Orange for assistance. The assistant told me that the credit was there and needed to be applied to my account, and then hung up. I then needed to top up as I was charged 25p for the call.

To be fair I'm only going to slightly sl*g off O2 as I think they sold my details to people who then tried to rip me off (who doesn't these days) obviously I cant prove that so O2 please don't sue me :) an even that was about 6 years ago.  To be fair I got with orange as the ex was working for them and my purchase gave her some commission and ergo me more beer tokens.

563,"Not fussy about credit rating, but network is too crowded","I'll start off with a positive point by saying that Orange seem to be much more willing than other networks to approve new customers after a credit check; I switched to them after T-mobile rejected my request for a new phone on a contract despite me having been a PAYG customer of theirs for over a decade, and despite offering to pay most of the cost of the handset up-front. I applied for an almost identical deal with Orange and it was approved, no problem (ironically Orange and T-mobile merged a couple of months later).However, I've found the network itself to be very poor. Very often my phone (Motorola Milestone) will report near-perfect signal, yet incoming phonecalls will go straight to voicemail, and despite having a ""3G"" icon and data apparently being sent out, nothing comes back and no internet applications work. These are chronic problems which, despite many interactions with various parts of Orange, seem to be unsolvable.I can only imagine that their network is too busy, and that they must resort to dropping calls and blocking data for this reason, but they have never actually suggested to me what the real cause of the problems might be. Perhaps the situation will improve now that they have merged with T-mobile, but until then, my rating stands.I've switched to Vodafone and their coverage with the same handset in the same locations is excellent.",Iddles W,2011,10,1,2,0.068,0.072,Positive

I upgraded to a new phone after my contract expired as the battery life was poor and had to always carry a spare battery or charger where ever I went.The new phone was a newly released phone. After a couple of months I noticed that my signal was poor despite the screen saying that I have full service. I kept losing signal when on calls and no calls lasted more than a minute before I lost the signal. I did not realise that it was the phone at first as I only really called mobiles and assumed it was the other end. I ended up having to send text messages. I was working in London and the signal was great, I made a call to a land line and the speech was broken. My old phone always had perfect signal in my office. I called Orange and they said that I was over exaggerating. The call centre operator called the phone while I was on the other line and she blamed it on the signal. Which was on full. She said that I would be sent a replacement phone. That one worked for around 2 weeks before it started playing up. I was sent another phone. It last a month. Then I was sent another phone it arrived with the exact same fault. In the end I was sent 7 replacement phones. I called customer services asking for a different mobile phone, I did not care which one I just wanted a working phone. They were not interested and said that I had only had 3 replacement phones. I had receipts to prove otherwise. I told them that if nothing was sorted out I would stop paying my bill. They told me that I would be in breach of contract and I had to pay my bill or they would take me to court. I went to my local store to be face to face with someone. I wanted them to see the phone and the problem I was suffering from. They told me about customer relations and how they would look into my problem and sort it out for me.  I wrote to them and was called back unfortunately I was not home at the time of the call. They left a message to say that they would call back. The number was an outgoing number only. I waited for another call but never got one. I called the customer services in hope that I could be put through to someone but they said without a name they could not. I wrote another letter telling them that I no longer want the phone as it does not work. They were supposed to supply a working phone and therefore they were in breach of contract. I refuse to pay line rental on a faulty phone. They could see by the lack of call charger that I was using the phone for calls. I ended up going to another company and got another contract while I still had 5 months left of my Orange contract. After 2 more months I was still trying to sort out the phone. Customer relations never spoke to me and I ended up dealing with customer services who told me that I had been issued a credit for the outstanding money and my contract had been cancelled. I thought that this was the end of it but Orange had affected my credit score. They promised to remove the bad rating they gave me however surprise surprise they never did!Funny Orange did phone me asking me if I wanted to get another phone and contract when my contract should have ended. I told them NO WAY, I would NEVER go to to Orange. I found Orange to be so unhelpful, basically accusing me of lying about the amount of replacement phones I had (when I could prove I was not), not calling back, saying that I was in breach of contract when it was the other way around.",Justine England,2011,6,12,1,0.099,0.058,Negative

I've only had a couple of service problems over the years and have been satisfied as a customer with how those problems were communicated and dealt with.  The only reason I left Orange 3 years ago for mobile phone services was because of iPhone and the fact that they didn't support it at the time.  It was a bit annoying when they went through the phase of takig a long time to assess and customise new handsets vefore offering them to customers, but that's not something I have much interest in these days so even if that's not changed it's not an issue for me.  Now they're back in the picture with iPhone and I can get a good iPad service form them too, I'm back with Orange because I've had nothing but a professional and slick service from them over the years.",Kate,2011,2,5,5,0.041,0.07,Positive

I'm told this is becasue they test phones more extensively before addin them to the range and I have no reason to believe this isn't true.  I'd recommend them based on my experience of Orange, O2 and Vodafone and with Orange now offering free access to the T-Mobile network (in the UK) performance from T-Mobile can't really be any better.

You don't have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful. When I had to call for a replacement phone in the past, I found them to be quite rude, in terms of asking if I usually allowed a three year old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that I should have been supervising them better. This was the only time I have ever felt quite angry with them but, as with most companies, if they are taking your money they are excellent, as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude!They are better than many providers (i.e 3) but probably not the best out there, I think I stay with them out of habit, more than because I get a brilliant deal with my contract. My friends are staggered that I pay over £40 pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn't all that either (which I'm stuck with for 18 mths!).",Sarah H,2010,12,23,3,0.088,0.143,Positive
837,Best network?,"I have been with orange for about 6 years and I will not be changing anytime soon. I have been both a pay as you go and pay monthly customer and with both they are really great. Magic numbers are without a doubt a financial life saver (unlimited calls to opted orange mobile numbers), although yes the person does have to be on orange to take advantage. The animal packages are also great. I am a faithful dolphin package user, when on pay as you go I got 300 free texts and free facebook, myspace and bebo for the month as long as I topped up by £10 (I always did). Now on pay monthly i get unlimited texts and 500mb internet which I have never been over. Animal packages are easy to choose between as they are layed out clearly on which package offers what so you know which one would be best for you.The only grievance I have with orange, although I believe most networks share this problem, is when you buy a handset from anywhere other than the orange shop they are not willing to help you out at all. This is the same if you upgrade through say carphone warehouse, if you have issues with the handset orange will not help you, so I recommend insurance if your phone is had value if brought through them.",JennaLL,2010,12,22,4,0.065,0.17,Positive

I have yet to hear a bad story about Orange and I'm not holding my breath, to be honest.

Orange customer service simply not interested in an complaints about their choice of courier, and not interested in helping to find out when DPD might actually deign to try and deliver it.  Apparently there is no complaints department and they don't bother to track problems with the courier.   A great example of how not to do customer care.",MikeB,2010,12,14,2,0.222,0.093,Negative

After trying to calm him down and explaining what I had been told by the salesperson on the phone, he eventually told me that he couldn't/wouldn't help.  He accused me of being offensive to him.  He also told me that he didn't know anything about my phone anyway - they were selling them!!!!!I requested that my new phone be returned to me and left the shop.I then went into Carphone Warehouse, with whom I had spent no money and an extremely helpful young man assisted me and when I asked how much I owed for the service, was told that there was no charge.  Zero out of ten to Orange - Ten plus to Carphone Warehouse!",Michael Nixon,2010,10,27,3,0.082,0.114,Positive

Two of the phones are pay as you go and repeatedly I've found their top-up line to not be working properly. 2. They keep sending promotional texts - since I work shifts and am on emergency call, this means they frequently wake me up in the middle of my ""night"". They've also sent texts at 7 a.m on a Sunday morning to my wife's phone - thanks for that guys! She really appreciates you ruining her one lie in! I've rang and had the texts stopped several times, but after 2 or 3 months they start doing it all over again. Them texting me when I'm asleep after working night shift is like me texting someone at 3 a.m - not appreciated, not funny and causes me to be tired next day due to being woken right in middle of my sleep.

I have rang a couple of times with queries and the phone has been answered swiftly and by someone who could help me - The signal where I live and work is excellent, and all in all, I think this is the happiest I have been with any network - if I am still in the same situation 3 months down the line, I would say this company provided a 5 star service, only time will tell!!",John Leigh,2010,9,13,4,0,0.147,Positive

998,Disappointment unlimited,"Apart from a one year break when I had totally lost faith with this network, I have been with Orange for at least nine years. Why? You may well ask when I am clearly so unhappy with them. The simple answer is that I live in a remote part of the country where, until recently, it was the only network that could provide fairly good coverage. That is the plus side. Here are the negatives. Customer services are ALWAYS ""experiencing a high volume of calls"", even if, as I once accidentally did, you call them out of hours when there is nobody there!! And the staff at these call centres are often hard to understand as most have Asian accents. I have experienced two major outages in the last few years lasting about THREE WEEKS. The first was during the Boscastle floods and I was told I was low priority as they had to maintain the transmitter there. Fair enough, but if the engineers were in the locality, surely they could also have fixed the transmitter near me as Boscastle is only eight miles away! The last one was over a month ago and STILL the signal, even at their transmitter, is below full strength. The people at the call centre tell me that they do not communicate with the engineers and cannot inform them when I tell them the network is down. When it does come back, the signal is often at half strength, and occasionally still vanishes altogether for around half an hour at a time. One person at the call centre said that if few people are affected by an outage, for example if there are few customers in that area, like where I live, the engineers do not exactly hurry to sort it out. As an experiment I put a Vodafone pay-as-you-go sim into a spare phone and monitored the signal every few minutes for a week. Fortunately I am retired and have the time! Not once did it fall below full strength signal. I now bitterly regret my decision recently to upgrade my phone and renew the contract and am seriously considering buying out of it as I have had enough hassle. All I want is a good signal from the transmitter which is only a mile and a half from my house! The Orange shop in Truro tell me that I am not alone in getting exasperated at the lack of decent network coverage. I have always said that companies that advertise a lot on television are desperate.

1003,"Mediocre network, Pathetic support","I'm on my last 2 months of an 18 month contract with Orange. This was my first Pay Monthly contract - previously I've only used Pay as you Go. Thus because this was my first contract my expectations weren't exactly high and I suppose in a way I wasn't expecting much better service than PayG.Network: Orange have just made a claim that they have the best (or fastest, I forget which) network, covering more UK people than any other network. Let me tell you, this is NOT the case. Whilst I've always been able to pick up some sort of reception around the country, around half of the time this was not usable and I had to ""do a little dance"" in different positions to get acceptable call quality. This is NOT what I expected when paying £45 /month.Support: I was on their top band (Band 6 I think it was) and I got their ""premier support team"" which one of their rep's said was their most advanced support team and I was privileged to get this. Well, I'm not sure how privileged I was with 10-15 minute waiting times, about 5 ""press 1 for..."" options to go through to get there, and rude & unsupportive reps. Definitely not what I expect for £45.Upgrades: Last month I was due to upgrade my mobile phone. I ordered with Phones4U which meant my account was ""locked"" and thus I couldn't upgrade before my 15 months - EVEN IF I WISHED TO PAY FOR THE HANDSET. -- why would they do that?So, 2 days before my upgrade date I call up Orange, wait 20 mins to speak to someone, and then ask them which phones are available. None of them tickled my fancy and I'd seen the HTC HD Mini in Carphone Warehouse which I quite liked. I asked if they could source me one of those - no; it's not on the regular list and ""we do not order in phones to please customers"". -- rude much?So, I gave him an ultimatum - either I would be able to order my HTC HD Mini on the date I was due to upgrade, or I'd go to another network that would give me one. Upgrade date - ring ring - ""Hello.... from Orange"" so I ask for the HTC HD Mini, only to get the same answer. I told the lady I would be changing network if I didn't get this phone and she said ""I'm sorry you feel this way"".Next day, I go and order a NEW contract with Vodafone through Phones4U, get everything sorted, all set up & left the shop within 20 mins. Yes, that's LESS TIME ordering a new phone than WAITING ON HOLD for Orange. Pathetic, right?Icing on the cake: 3 days after ordering my new phone on a new contract, I get another call from Orange asking why I haven't chosen to upgrade yet. I told the guy that I wouldn't be supplied with the handset that I wanted (didn't tell him I'd already got it on Voda!) and he went through the same procedure with me, but (!!) when I told him I was thinking of changing to Vodafone all hell broke loose; he was then willing to give me the same handset at the same price as Voda were!I think it's absolutely ABYSMAL that you've got to threaten leaving the company for them to give you what you want. I was paying £45 /month - surely that was enough to keep me happy? What a bunch of *something I can't say in this review*Why should I have to put up with poor network coverage, expensive monthly bills (now paying £20 less on Voda for same usage limits and same price handset), ridiculous support that takes an age to pick up AND right hand doesn't know what the left is doing?

1007,Purchased online - problems with options,"Hi, I bought an HTC online with a 12 months contracts. I also added a 250 MB internet download. Total cost £38.First month I have paid around £40, more expensive but ok, I sent some picture text.Second month I had a £65 bill! I phoned up Orange to understand what was wrong, and they simply told I did not have the internet download in my contract. I explained that the option had been ticked online when purchased, but nothing to do, they told the only way was to pay the full amount, and the option would be actived the following month.So I am giving a bad review because of very poor customer service. Phone is great, network cover is acceptable, call charges are above the average.I do not recommend orange online. If you wish to go ahead anyway, make sure to phone customer service after receiving the mobile and ensure you have all the options you have subscribed to.Last thing, purchasing online without setting up a direct debit will cost you an additional £2.85 exc VAT a month. Maybe worth taking into consideration if you are benchmarking different providers.Thanks,Mr Hubert",Mr Hubert,2010,6,24,2,0.111,0.143,Positive

1010,Orange have good tariffs,Customer service is fairly efficient.  Their tariffs are really good and you can swap easily.  You can get 2-4-1 on cinema and pizza express on wednesdays.,Tracey Madden,2010,6,21,4,0,0.267,Positive
1011,Dreadful customer service,"My son bought a PAYG phone from an Orange store and the handset has proved faulty.  It has been repaired twice but although the handset is only 9 months old the shop is completely refusing to accept responsibility and will not provide a repair, replacement or refund.  The only option offered is for us to contact a 3rd party repair company (called 'Regenesis').  I would never deal with this company again.",S A W,2010,1,11,1,0.075,0.098,Positive

1013,Gangsters,"I should've trusted my instincts and cut my losses with them after getting poor customer service for my broadband and finally I had to terminate my contract after 5 years with them.   Unfortunately now that my daughter has started using text I went back to them thinking nothing would go wrong with using their SIM card, oh how wrong was I.  Every SIM card package clearly stated 300 free text, after 8 text i was charged 10p thereafter, now I live in hope of getting my money back.",Jayema,2009,4,2,2,0.122,0.172,Positive
