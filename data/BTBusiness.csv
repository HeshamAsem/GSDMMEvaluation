It is a restaurant so all these are business critical and essential to us.             Out of the blue on Monday 28th February, to my utter shock, I received a letter saying ""Sorry you're leaving"" your services will cease on Wednesday 2nd March... As you can imagine that caused so much panic and headache to try and get through to BT and see why this was the case as I never said I wanted to leave. The advisor told me not to worry as they checked and the number port cease request had been actioned and my number and telephone broadband wont be affected.             Come Wednesday 2nd, I found we had no line or broadband so I contacted BT and after being passed from team to team and on hold for a great deal of time I was seen to.  My complaint from 15th Feb was reopened and I was told it was being investigated and they would need to request a reversion restore of services from a department which deals with bringing numbers back, I was assigned a Complaint Manager (CM).             Openreach sent a form to CM requesting more info to be provided to them which he did. However after that it went radio silent, I was phoning up every single day bearing in mind it had been well over 2 weeks and nothing was heard from openreach or BT. Surely if Openreach aren't responding to the escalations chaser from the CM, the CM could talk to a senior manager? We've never defaulted on payments, always had a prompt care package across all our products so should anything catastrophic like this happen then we are seen to and a solution provided as a priority.  Being such loyal and long standing customers of BT seems like it means nothing to them, nor are they worried about the wider effect this is having both mentally and financially to my family and me. The roof over our heads is hanging in the balance as well as the survival of our business. Our livelihood is in jeopardy. We have lost business due to this BT system error. Two years COVID had brought us to standstill and now this year BT have brought us down to our knees. We are very very worried about the business surviving.             Somehow, the telephone number has started working even though it's showing as inactive and in quarantine, which is really baffling?! I was told yesterday a request was sent for the number to be moved out of quarantine and show as an active PSTN to allow for this new CloudVoice service to be ordered and they should get back within 24hrs. It has surpassed that timeframe and last I heard it was still sitting in the Recovery team's queue!             I apologise for the lengthy overview, but I am at wits end now, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, it has gone on far too long and the response has been severely inadequate. I cannot believe how we are still without service.  Please please please can anyone help or advise?             Thanks ",24,Mar,2022,19,mji1,Phone-systems

However I have been unable to retain my telephone number of 50+ years that has been in this same house since I was a child - I am 62 now.             I have been given various reasons that seem to change depending on wind direction and whether I talk to (R)Residential or (B)Business and range from              No problem - it can be ported across (R)      We can port your telephone number across (B)      It's in a normal PSTN pool (R&amp amp B)      It's in an ISDN pool (B)      You should be able to retain your number (R)      You can't retain your number (B)      We can't do anything - you need to talk to Business (R)      We can't do anything - you need to talk to Residential (B)             etc. etc...I'm sure you get the idea.             I find it staggering in this day &amp amp  age of technology and telephone numbers following you around wherever you go in the country that this particular number (it's nothing special but it's MY number and is still live on the copper network) cannot be ported from BT Residential to BT Business for some unknown and possibly illogical reason.             I have requested that someone from either side of the BT family please give me the reason it can't be done but of course they can't won't and how could they if they don't even know the reason themselves?             On what was my 4th telephone conversation about this today Business done some top line checks and told me at first there should be no problem porting it across but would do a deeper dive while I was on hold on completion of which was told it now could not be ported across. I was also told it was futile to pursue it further, try to escalate or even make a complaint as his Manager would turn to the same testing that had just returned a 'Computer says no' response and I was in fact already talking to the Complaints Officer and it would go nowhere and just stay on his desk!

Cancel my order with Business and go back to Residential Full Fibre 900 and retain my telephone number but no static IP address although I do get 12 months Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

Continue with my Business order to obtain a static IP address but lose my telephone number.             I can't even ask that the copper PSTN pair be retained purely for voice service as BT have a 2025 cut-off date for copper (yeah...right) and I'll just end up kicking the problem down the road for a few years even if this were an option and so it's not a solution unless BT can pull a rabbit out of a hat in the interim.             Also what did those of you with an analogue PBX do when you went over to Cloud Voice Express? My PBX has a VoIP card that has worked well with 3rd Party providers but not of course the BT proprietary DV VCE service.             If only BT had not gone with a proprietary VoIP service I might even have been able to use a 3rd Party solution utilising the RJ11 ports on my existing router having ported my number from BT Residential to the 3rd Party VoIP provider which I'm told is possible. But BT Residential can't port the same number to BT Business?             I realise there are two distinct branches under the BT umbrella but as far as the customer is concerned BT is BT isn't it?

So we got the contracts and signed them with the understanding that we were able to keep our current business landline number.             Yesterday, I received a call from my local account manager who is handling the switch to inform me that BT cloud team are unable to transfer our business landline number as they are unable to port it from cloudvoice express. He explained that this is because the number has never been a traditional landline number and has only ever been cloudvoice express. He presented me with the option to continue with the order and take a new landline number or cancel the order or keep 2 separate subscriptions and forward the calls from our current landline to the new landline.             As a business its vitally important to keep the same landline number as this number becomes associated with the business. It ends up on marketing material and more. It's impractical to reprint all material and then tell current clients that unfortunately BT can't move our number to the new service we require.             Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone managed to get this issue fixed?             I don't particularly want to keep my current subscription and pay for the new one however, we need the functionality of the cloud voice service. This issue would also prevent us from switching supplier to get the functionality elsewhere as the number wouldn't be portable.             Really would appreciate any help with this.

10,Absolute Nightmare Getting a Line Installed,https://business.forums.bt.com/t5/Phone-line/Absolute-Nightmare-Getting-a-Line-Installed/m-p/85967#M3584,"Hi there,             I scarcely know where to begin, our tale of woe has been ongoing for about a year. I am writing on behalf of Crich Baptist Church, in Derbyshire. Wayback, early in 2021 I contacted BT Business to have the telephone and broadband installed at the church.             The engineer duly arrived, but with the church being clad in scaffolding at the time due to major refurbishment works, he advised us that there was nothing he could do because of the scaffolding. We accepted this, and agreed to arrange another appointment when the scaffolding was removed. It is important in this long-running saga, to say that the church is Grade II listed, so it is essential to say that you can’t just attach anything to the outside of the building that would contravene any conservation observations by the local planning authority. This has been repeatedly emphasised to people we have spoken to at BT, plus of course, the engineers when they have arrived on site.                         I should say that BT Business, in Stoke, advised us initially that the product we needed was Cloud Voice Express. Subsequently, after several months, we were told that this would not be appropriate for us, so a normal line would be needed. We have supply poles, with distribution boxes attached which are nearby, there is at least one ‘carrier pole’ within yards of the church, but the problem with that, is the line, if so attached there would be too low across a busy road. The green boxes containing the connections from the Exchange are just outside the church wall. I humorously often say that if they were any closer they would be inside!             Orders have been raised then cancelled. New orders have been placed, then they have been cancelled and others raised, and on and on it goes. Sometimes, with each new order, new kit has been sent, including Smart Hubs, Hybrid connections, plus the round Wi-Fi discs. I joke that we must have more kit that BT. When I have raised this with visiting engineers and people on the phone, I have been advised not to send the equipment back just yet, and so it continues to build up.             An important factor is to say that we have had one access survey. This went well, the guy was fantastic, and we really thought we were getting somewhere at last. The surveyor told us, that in his opinion the line should be brought in underground. He took measurements, both outside the church and in. A quote for the extra work was raised and accepted. Since then, nothing has happened. I suspect someone has vetoed that idea.             The idea was eventually raised that we needed a second survey. Since then, despite several attempts by me to push the matter, absolutely NOTHING has been mentioned to us about this idea.             Literally, I have spent hours and hours on the phone, both to order management in India, and various folks here in the UK. We were ’told’ to raise a complaint, the BT staff seem to have done that. My personal view after spending what seems half my life on this matter, is that having order management in India and other BT   Openreach offices here in the UK is not a great idea, and may be part of the problem.                         I have also WASTED TIME down at the church on numerous occasions, when appointments have been made within a time-slot, say 8am-1pm, only for no engineer to turn up. Later, I have discovered that they have done work at the exchange and not needed to come to the church. If that was to be the case WHY was that not made clear in the e-mail I received announcing the appointment. An e-mail incidentally, which threatened us with a penalty of £130 if access to the church was not available for the engineer.             Yet another engineer’s visit is arranged for Thursday, 17th February, in a time-slot of 1pm-6pm. I am not at all confident that this will be anything other than ‘more of the same’. By the way, the engineers are good guys, so I don't blame them for the debacle.             So much more could be written, but lest I bore the pants off you by writing even more, it is utter incompetence! By whom, and where, is for others to judge, I know what I think. Let me just conclude by   STRONG PLEADING for the SECOND SURVEY   STRONG  to be arranged as suggested. That, I feel, would at least give us, BT &amp amp  Openreach a better idea what needs to be done.             I hope that someone who reads this may be able to help.

The man in the house across the road later told me he had left Sky and just switched to BT in July.      It turned out they day we lost our services he was connected and given OUR business phone number as his new number!      The day we were re-connected he lost his services.      On 7 August the stream of 'sorry you are leaving us' BT letters and emails began again.      I have contacted BT every day since 9 August as the BT order provisions team tell me they have removed the unauthorised ceases but they never do. They are still showing on our account.      Now we are due to lose our services on 23 August when I guess they will re-connect the man cross the road to our line again as that is the same day the open reach engineer is scheduled to visit him to reconnect him!      I have been going round in circles. We are a small business with 3 employees and the majority of our business is ecommerce. We lose our phone and internet and we stop dead.       Does anyone know what else I can do?       It seems to be a mix up of address'.      I have given BT every detail of information regarding this situation. I have also sent letters and online complaint forms as well as all the phone calls and stiill it is not resolved. ,18,Aug,2021,19,motocdotcom,Phone-systems

Probably wrong forum for the question but - There is a very old (20-25 years old) BT terminal block in the adjacent hall where we want broadband. If the line comes in here can we run an extension 150 feet or so to the vestry, or is that too far, especially as we need to conect a modem for WiFi somewhere?             Thanks for the help.

I've tried everything I can think of but nothing works.                               On the feature phone there is a red light to indicate either if a message has been left, the phone is ringing or the phone is in use. This light is permanently on and I’m assuming that this has something to do with the problem.                               Can anyone help me please? ",24,Apr,2018,14,Raymo,Phone-systems

First of all my issue is concerning my business phone account, I have been over charged for a number of months due to a premium subscription not being removed from my account. I decided to give BT a call, I believe I got through to a call centre possibly in India. I discussed my account query and was advised someone would call me back.....two weeks later still no call back. So I attempted to call BT for the second time, again same script from customer service person, someone will call me back...no joy. A week later I decided to call BT again and asked to cancel my account, at this stage I was losing all confidence in this service. I managed to get connect to a call centre within the UK and someone was able to confirm I have been overcharged and acknowledged my account will be credited. I was further advised to deduct £72.00 from the bill I was due to pay. Great! so I thought...no. One week later I received a letter from BT stating I owe them £72.00. So I contacted BT again, stupidly I decided to go through the correct channels to the customer helpline and was connected to a nice chap from India, but as expected he was unable to assist me with this matter and gave me the usual script that someone will phone me back... I asked the nice chap to put me through to someone who can address this matter...I was informed this was not possible and his manager was busy.          A second letter arrives from BT stating I owe this amount and my line will be cut off! My partner then receives a call out of the blue from BT, advising we will receive a cheque of £124.00, so at this stage we think this matter has been addressed… No I was sadly wrong. We then receive a third letter from BT stating the line will be cancelled etc... I decide to lodge an official complaint via the BT website. Seven days pass by no response received. I decide to contact the BT customer service line requesting to leave. I was advised by a nice lady that my previous complaint has not been assigned on the system and she informed me someone will be in touch from their accounts team. My account has been put on hold and I was told not to worry you won’t get cut off.          One week later 14 09 2016 my telephone line has been cut off! I again…. phone BT cancellation team. I spoke to a helpful chap who listens to my concerns for what feels like the 100th time and then forwards me to someone from their accounts teams. This person from the accounts team looked in to the issue, and agreed I have been overcharged. He informs me my complaint is not on the system, I asked him will someone be in touch to discuss my complaint..he said I will get my manager to give you a call when he returns from his day off…(okay) He advised my account will be reconnected… but 3 hours later still no line.. I have seriously lost all hope in BT. I am now in the process of looking to change telephone providers. After 20 plus years being with BT I am disgusted with the lack of appropriate systems to resolve minor issues. I have wasted so much time and money making these calls and getting nowhere!

I have already identified an easy way into the premises coincidentally the closest to the CBT on the pole, run down a set of rods to act as a fish to pull fibre from the CSP on the wall outside into the building roof space and also run a drawtape down from the roofspace via some trunking into the office where I would like the ONT located which is adjacent to the existing BT modem and 3 NTE5 sockets where I have cleared enough access for the Engineer to work.

I ask because I will need to change DNS, Port Forward, Reserve Bind IP address, disable Wi-Fi etc.      2. Assuming I won't privilege enough to do all of the above I assume that I should be able to plug the DrayTek directly into the ONT (it is already set for BT Infinity 2 so has the username   A href=""mailto:bthomehub@btbroadband.com"" target=""_blank"" bthomehub@btbroadband.com   A  with the password field left blank. Is there anything else I need to do to enable a direct connection?      3. I assume if I do the above then I won't have any voice service as this depends upon the SmartHub 2 being connected so I can plug the supplied phone into the socket on the back. Is there any way then I can put the SH2 into Bridge Mode and plug the DrayTek into the SH2 to maintain my network integrity and retain telephony?      4. If I am able to put it into Bridge Mode is it a 'proper' bridge Mode where it offloads everything such as DHCP, DNS, VPN, Remote Access etc. and my DrayTek handles everything over its WAN2 PPoE connection as it currently does plugged directly into the NTE5 connected to FTTC Infinity 2 at 80 20MB? The reason I ask is I have a Raspberry Pi configured as a Pi-hole ad-blocker and use its internal IP address as my network DNS Server rather than some hard-coded external BT DNS Server in the SH2 that can't be bypassed changed.

I've also shared my experience further down...          Anyone using VDSL FTTC wanting to switch to a 3rd party router, these are the settings should your modem require one:     VLAN-ID Tag: 101     PBit: 0     VPI: 0     VCI: 35     Encapsulation: PPPoE     Authentication: CHAP      If you have static IP,  using the Broadband userid and password provided instead of the default (  A href=""mailto:btbusinesshub@business.btclick.com,"" target=""_blank"" btbusinesshub@business.btclick.com,   A  no password) is advised.      As for my experience:     I run a small business with a couple of satellite office and folks working from home. Neither we nor any of our employees used BT until Monday after a wave of insanity hit me and I decided to save a couple of hundred pounds a year by switching to BT Business for 2 sites.  We switched on Monday and its been 4 days of pain,  only alleviated by discarding all the BT provided equipment this afternoon.  So no Cloud Voice either, and no ""Hybrid backup"".      There were no positives.      Here are the negatives I encountered:     BT Business Smart Hub 2's cannot route, even after upgrading to the current firmware v0.19.01.01105-BT.  There is a reason they call it Hub rather than router!  You can set a limited number of routes (to all RFC 1918 addresses except 10.0.0.0) but they only work for the Hub, almost.  Its not a router.  If you use its DHCP, the default route is to the router - no static routes to your VPN are given out, no ICMP redirects for internal hosts to your VPN or any other  local network+router, and no routing to them either.          You lose around 5% line speed in the DSL connection and large uploads kill downloads.  For WiFi, you cannot split the SSID between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, nor customise the guest SSID nor set a password for it, and WiFi is measurably slower than the two other manufacturers I used previously (and now use again).  You only have a choice of 3 channels fo 2.4Ghz and 4 for 5Ghz (there are 24 wireless networks in one of the buildings, which requires a delicate choice). You cannot login to the Hub externally. You cannot customise your internal domain name. You cannot assign a host a static IP addresses (i.e IPv4 address to a MAC address) until that host is on the network (i.e. you  have to let DHCP give it an address from the pool, then fix it to an IP address)      The GUI is poor.  Adding DNS host names and routes is only permissible 1 at a time.  i.e. Add+Save is required.  You can add multiple and then save, but it does not actually save.      So whatever I saved on the monthly fees I lost over the course of the last 4 days (plus time+cost travelling between offices to reset Hubs, change settings, etc).

The same would be true, I think, for any service that is relying on a static IP address for routing - UNLESS BT have done something clever with the allocation of IP addresses.

Unfortunately I don't seem able to configure it to match the existing wired router. In particular I'm trying to configure static routes so packets destined for the VPN get sent to the local VPN router which knows what to do with them.             The Smart Hub 2 router is handing out IP addresses in the range 192.168.4.1 and 192.168.4.253 .             The VPN router has IP address of 192.168.4.10 from that router.             The static route I'm trying to set up is      subnet IP: 192.168.1.0 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 gateway IP 192.168.4.10             The error message I'm getting is      'Invalid gateway IP: 192.168.4.10. Only allow value between 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.253.'             As the 'allow value' IP addresses aren't routeable in the 192.168.4.0 24 network, it implies that static routes are not possible. But there is a web interface dedicated to giving them.             Have I missed something? How do I set these routes up? We have a range of routers doing exactly that on other sites so I'm just trying to get it to do what the existing router is doing. I can't just stick the hybrid connect box on the existing router because it needs to pair with the smart hub to work.             Thanks to anyone who can shed light on this.

(The obvious one) - so you can provide a way for users outside your network to access your services.             2. So the users inside your network can access services on external machines in the cloud, where those machines use IP addresses to control user access.             BT is doing (1). I don't understand why they are using the dynamic address of the hub as the source address when forwarding out from the local 192.168 network.             Surely the base address of my 7 ip addresses, used internally on the local network for routing, is available for use. It's there, all that needs to happen is to change the Hub setup to use it. If this is not technically possible, then I'd like to know why.             OK I can use a VPN, but given that my broadband is not really super fast, I don't want to slow connections down.             However.

I have tried ringing bt customer service and spent over an hour on the phone  but they haven't been any helpful to say the least.  The person kept going around circles about the everything so here I am.             A bit of background, so I have had a business broadband package with BT for over 5 years now and up till now we had been using a white Openreach dsl modem. I had a broadband cable going from the wall socket (openreach mk4) to the dsl port on openreach dsl modem and then an ethernet cable going from Lan1 on the dsl modem to a Draytek Vigor 2925 router. Everythig had been working fine but I decided to upgrade my package and get their latest deal for broadband + phone + hybrid connect.             Now they sent me a BT Smart Hub 2, an ip phone for their digital phone line and a hybrid connect device. I wanted to use to same third party Draytek router so I put the SH2 into bridge mode and connected the Draytek router to one of the lan ports on the SH2. I tried the WAN port on SH2 but there was no internet on that so I just plugged into on of the four ethernet ports and my Draytek is working...BUT not without issues. I am getting wifi speed of upto 65-70mb on wireless devices BUT on my computer that's connected through an etehrnet cable is only getting around 5-6 mb download and most of the times when i go on speedtest.net to test, it stays on connecting when I hit the go button and never runs thes test. Speedtest app on mobile shows around 60-70 mb as well. So does anyone know what could be the issue here? Why such slow speeds on the wired connection?             Some other questions as well If any of you can answer them for me.             1 - Ever since I turned the SH2 into bridge mode, the round led light on it stays on solid orange. According to the guidebook solid orange led means there is something wrong with the service, but in a normal mode SH2 shows blue led but in bridge mode it turns orange. So is it supposed to turn orange in bridge mode or is there something acutally wrong with it?             2 - My ip phone (Yealink W60B) is supposed to be connected to the SH2. But when I connect to SH2, it doesn't get any connection so I thought maybe because its in bridge mode. So I tried connecting to Draytek where it picked up the network but still wouldnt't pick up the line ability to call. Whenever I try to ring it says ""unknown uri scheme"" and when I press the line button on the phone it, it shows empty menu.             3 - The Hybrid Connect 4g device is also supposed to be connected to SH2 but it keeps flashing blue without being able to link to the SH2. Once again I doubt its because the SH2 is in the bridge mode. But is there anyway I can have it set up and connected to SH2 even if the SH2 is in the bridge mode.             4- General question regarding SH2, does it have the ability to bind an ip to a mac address like the Draytek router so even if the whole system gets rebooted, some devices such as cctv get the same ip for remote viewing. I read sometning about the ip reservations but I am not sure if its 100 percent same as binding ip address to mac address.             I wish I could use SH2 but in my experience over the past 5 plus years with BT, their routers just aren't good enough so I have to use the Draytek but its causing so much issues with the digital phone line,hybrid connect and the slow ethernet speeds. At the moment, the only thing I can think of is to use the SH2 in normal mode and just buy a switch to plug everything into it but I am not sure if SH2 is going to able to set up port forwarding and binding ips for remote access to devices such as cctv and epos systems.

Lost Email?",https://business.forums.bt.com/t5/Broadband/Merging-2-Adsl-lines-into-1-Fibre-line-same-business-name-and/m-p/84569#M15503,"Hi,      Can someone please help me get some clarity on this, I have rang BT several times recently, different representatives say different things, some of which doesn't make sense to me.             The situation is very simple but for some reason its made to sound more complex when talking on the phone, one of those things that is easier written down I think.                    Our business used to have two lines.      One for Phone      One for Fax.      We originally, 20+ years ago, setup internet on the Fax line when it was dial-up, later upgrading to adsl broadband.      Presumably a fairly common situation I'd bave thought.             We no longer use Faxes so wanted to do away with that line.      Some BT sales man, in about 2017 offered us Adsl Broadband on our phone line, which we accepted, the idea was, as he explained it, setup adsl on our main phone line, then swap our old broadband package over, including Emails, etc. then cancel the other line altogether..             As it turned out our phoneline gave less than half the speed of the fax line, we had the engineer out 5 times or so without any progress.      So in the end we kept both adsl broadband packages.  (one of the engineers fobbed us of that it would get faster the more it was used, but it didn't, and by then was too late to cancel..)      We had heard fibre was coming soon, so hoped to complete the transfer then.             Fast forward May 2021, I ordered Full Fibre 150 with cloud voice on what was the phone line.      When ordering I explained the situation regards us not wanting to have the 2 broadband packages, and wanting it transfered as was originally supposed to happen.      I asked multiple times throughout the process if there would be any issues transfering our emails over, my dad the business owner is in the process of important rent negotiations..      The BT representatives, almost laughed at the question, ofcourse Sir, no interuption at all as long as your Billing account is the same..  Emails follow the account number not the phone number I was told.      I spoke to at least 5 BT people who made these assurances. Two from the marketing setup, then when they put the order to BT proper I was keen to check again, the initial person confirmed what I'd been told, then when he forwarded me to the man who actually recorded the order I checked with him as well.      My mind was put at rest.             Last week our contract on our old adsl broadband was finally up so I put in the cancel order.      I also checked with the man who processed that, he assured me there was no problem.  So I went ahead and put the cancel order in.             Immediately a confirmation email came through listing all the services we would be losing, including all our original email addresses.             I assumed this was an error on the automated email, so I rang BT to check.      No Sir, you can't have those email address if you cancel that package, he said. I explained the situation.      He said there was no way at all to transfer anything over from our old package and it was a totally different system now..      He was completely unhelpful, I offered to pay extra to in some way retain them, he just answered that it wasn't possible to everything I suggested...             To me this is ludicrous.      We are paying more money for a higher package and we are losing important business email addresses and there is nothing we can do to transfer them over?   We are at the same Business Name, Address and Account numbers.             I rang back the next day hoping to get someone else, and actually they did appear to be making an effort to help, but in the end they said there is nothing they can do short of rescinding the cancel order on the original adsl broadband package.             Again, for me this just can't be right, we have Full Fibre 150 coming into the property about 3 meters away from our old fax adsl line giving us 20x the speed and we are told we have to retain the old adsl package just to keep our business emails?      Its crazy.                           The reason I am querying this here, I figure this surely can't be the first time this issue has come up, indeed I'd have thought it was quite common, a lot of small businesses used to have seperate fax lines, later changing to mainly internet, which presumably get dropped for Fibre lines in recent years?      There must be a way forward, yet on the phone I am met with confusion and very long waits causing me to wonder if they are messing me around, I feel like putting in an offical complaint.

I rang and signed up to a new broadband and cloud based phone system with BT on 12th March and was told it would take 2 weeks to move over.  By the 15th of March the order had been internally cancelled so a 2nd order was put through.  After a week I chased this order only to be told it had been put through wrong and a 3rd order needed to be raised and my 2 week deadline extended further.  Towards the end of this two weeks again my third order got cancelled with the explanation this time that Open reach said our lines were too old and needed upgrading so a 4th order needed to be put through to rectify this.  The date the 4th order was due to complete was 23rd April and this was the date I was given for the Open reach engineers appointment.  On the 23rd I got an email to say this order had been cancelled and a 5th order needed to be put through.  I called (one of the many times!) and was promised this 5th order could not be cancelled and would be expedited to 26th and I would get an email to confirm this.  I got no email as well as no replies to any of my emails and texts in relation to the complaint raised over this situation.  I called again on the 26th basically to be told the person from the 23rd was just telling me what I wanted to hear and there was no way it would be expedited, my new date would be 10th to 12th of May, but that they would try and expedite the cloud phone order so that at least I could organise a phone divert to my mobile (as we are without a phone line at the company now for over 6 weeks).  I was due to be updated on this by yesterdat but so far nothing, I have sent a text to my complain ref text and no reply or call.             Can someone help I don't know what to do?

Had an interesting fault develop. I think the businesshub has become corrupted. (Tried factory reset but oroblem persits). I think I need a new hub sent out. We had a flickering type power fault in our area.       Problems details follow:      When connecting wirelessly or wired to the hub the DHCP  addresses are only set correctly for IPV6. IPV4 addresses get allocated to windows (and android) as 192.168.0.108 etc...       However the default for the hub is 192.168.1.254       I can connect wirelessly but due to the ip mismatch but for everything that requires ipv4 nothing is routed correctly . If I statically change the ip address on a laptop to 192.168.1.202 and set the default gateway to 192.168.1.254. DNS to 192.168.1.254 (or 8.8.8.8)  Everything works.       Interestingly the All of the hubs settings have remained the same. But as of this afternoon only IPV6 addresses get correct settings from the DHCP. So only sites using IPV6 are accessible.       The IP address of the hub is still 192.168.1.254 the subnet mask is still 255.255.255.0      The DHCP range is still     192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.253 (Default)           But the IPV4 addresses received by the connecting machines are all in the range 192.168.0.100 - 120 or so.       Is this common? A hardware faut?  Or perhaps a firmware update that has a bug?          Though the firmware hasn't updated that recently....               BT Business Hub 5 (Type A) | Software version 4.7.5.1.83.8.267 | Last updated 20 11 19                         As a workaround I am going to try and get all ipv4 stuff I need to work setup with static addresses. (Or I might be able to set up an independent dhcp server if I can find a spare box or the time)....       I have held the firmware reset button in for fifteen seconds or so as advised that this might sort it out (when turning off and on again did not work)....      The same problem persists.  So think there is something more severe happening Perhaps the box is on it's way out.       How would I go about getting a replacement?      I'll try the business helpline in the morning in between Zoom Classes and nursery runs and work e-mails.      And update if anyone has simlair issues....

Everything is fine until a user connects to the server via vpn and then all forwarded ports stop working and when we look in the hub config page it has changed the ip we are forwarding to to another random IP so we then have to go back into hub and set it back to 10.0.0.5.      All is then fine again until a users connects to the server and the ip changes to another random one again.      I presume its because the hub is not actually forwarding to 10.0.0.5 but infact forwarding to the mac address and when some connects to the server it makes the hub change its ip.      Any help greatly recvd.      Andrew ,13,Jan,2021,14,jencomp24,Broadband

95,Constant disconnection of BT Business Smart Hub 088315 for 6 months - BT out of ideas...,https://business.forums.bt.com/t5/Broadband/Constant-disconnection-of-BT-Business-Smart-Hub-088315-for-6/m-p/83709#M15326,"Hello,      I'm at my whits end with this as i've exhausted nearly every possible resource available to try and resolve the issue.  Started about 6 months ago when we suddenly started getting alot of drop offs and disconnects with the router.  Usually starts in the morning and stops around 4-5pm so basically during work hours.  We're a small medium size supermarket with a relatively normal network.  The hub supplies the main network which is then connected to a server and patch units to relay the signal to other ports around the store.  We also have another router on the shopfloor which supplies wifi to the card machines.  Theres roughly around 76 devices connected to the hub currently.      The router will lose connection randomly throughout the day, it could be twice, it could be 10 times a day.  Weirdly the connection will be stable through the weekend and we get ZERO drop offs then, its only Monday to Friday... When the connection drops off, it usually reconnects fairly quickly, usually around a minute or 2 but sometimes does take longer.  Theres been the odd time where we've had to manually switch it off and turn it back on again for it to regain a connection.  The lights will switch to orange yellow before going back to blue.      So far BT engineers have been out around 5 times to see about fixing the issue but they've also exhausted all efforts now.  They have:      UL   LI Changed the lines   LI   LI Changed the lines on the outside box down the road   LI   LI Changed the connection lines on the outside box down road to a different number   LI   LI Changed and replaced the port on the phone line to a proper BT one with the appropriate filter   LI   LI Checked for Interference twice and both times detected nothing   LI   LI Changed the router for a new one   LI   LI Changed the Ethernet cables for a different one   LI   LI Changed the ADSL filter to the BT supplied one   LI   LI Swapped the line to another tel number    LI    UL   As you can see, its quite an extensive list, i probably missed some but this is what i remember off the top of my head that had been tested and carried out.  The engineer said the logs don't really tell them anything thats causing the drop offs other than ""It has lost connection and reconnected"".      I'm started to think the issue isn't with the line itself but with how many devices are connected to the Hub and it simply cannot handle it.  This issue only started around the time when we had a influx of new staff join our office which meant a whole bunch of new hardware had to be connected to the network inc phones, computers and new wifi till card readers etc.  Im suggesting this might be the issue because i had a similar issue at home with my virgin hub where it could disconnect constantly because it couldn't handle all the devices connected.  Again this only occurred after i decided to install a large amount of smart devices, once i changed the router to a mesh system the problem disappeared.  My theory lies heavily on the fact that during the weekend no drop offs occur and this is also the time when most of the office staff are off duty meaning most of the devices that would be connected during the weekday are offline.             Could anyone concur that this could be the issue that the hub router simply cannot handle all the devices connected to it?  Would a aftermarket more powerful router or mesh system help with this issue for our store?                 This is the socket that BT as installed which i've just noticed is the same as the other thread that is having connection issues.  However there is no micro filter in place before the router, the line simply connects straight to the router.  How would i get a micro filter in place or is there something else i can do to test whether this is causing the issue?

From that screen, I can navigate to the domains and I can see that my domain is still valid until 2022.  It also says I have a hosting option active.             The weird part though is that there is no account number, just an account name ""Group 1"".  I have not been billed from this account for about 3 years, except for the invoices for the actual domain names every couple of years which were successfully paid.               The screen claims that there is no billing account associated with this account.  A long time ago, I raised this with BT and asked them why they had stopped charging me for the hosting but they never came back to me.             The above account settings has been like that for a long time (at least 2 years), but the mail forwarding has still been working find during all that time.             I can then navigate to the option ""Domains, Hosting and Office 365"" - there I can then check my email settings, ""review and manage your email accounts"".             These settings appear correct and it appears to be correctly set to forward the mails to my btinternet account.

Is this purely for email, or does it allow you to access the online version of Word Excel etc? I've seen elsewhere that you need to pay about £3.80 per month per user for the service, so I'm not sure what's what).             Also, how do we get access? I saw somewhere else on BT's website that login details would be emailed, but we've never received anything, although.... BT has saddled us with a btconnect.com email address (they gave it to us years ago). Whilst I can login to BT's own website using this email, we've never, ever used it for anything but logging in to BT. All other correspondence (e.g. bill notifications, and messages regarding recent switchover to Cloud Voice Express) have always come to our main company email, which is something entirely different. Is it likely they've used the btconnect email for any Office 365 messages? To be honest, I don't even know where to sign in to read btconnect emails (why must we be saddled with an email address we don't want and never use?? why can't be use our main business email, like we do for everything else?)

Simple question but is there a simple answer ?             The first thing I would like to point out is - please educate your support people into the fact that because someone is sending out email from my email address, it does NOT mean that my account or computer have been compromised. When an email address has been 'Spoofed' it means exactly that - it's been faked.     Accounts versus addresses     Let me say that again: my email address is one thing, and my email account is another.     • My email account is what I use to log in and gain access to the email I've received. In most cases, it’s also what I use to log in in order to be able to send email.     • My email address is the information that allows the email system to route messages to my inbox. It’s what I give other people, like I might give you mike@whoever.com.     The two are related only to the extent that email routed to me using my email address is placed into the inbox accessed by my email account.     OK, I know that spammers can send email spoofing the “From:” address to make it look like it came from me.     How do they gain access to my account to do that? Have I been hacked?     No. I have not been hacked.      “From” spoofing means faking the “From:” address on an email to make it look like it came from me. To do it, spammers don’t need access to my account at all.     They only need the email address.      While an email account and an email address are related, they are not the same thing. ",12,Jan,2020,11,mikej101,Webhosting

So we got the contracts and signed them with the understanding that we were able to keep our current business landline number.             Yesterday, I received a call from my local account manager who is handling the switch to inform me that BT cloud team are unable to transfer our business landline number as they are unable to port it from cloudvoice express. He explained that this is because the number has never been a traditional landline number and has only ever been cloudvoice express. He presented me with the option to continue with the order and take a new landline number or cancel the order or keep 2 separate subscriptions and forward the calls from our current landline to the new landline.             As a business its vitally important to keep the same landline number as this number becomes associated with the business. It ends up on marketing material and more. It's impractical to reprint all material and then tell current clients that unfortunately BT can't move our number to the new service we require.             Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone managed to get this issue fixed?

40,BT Cloud Voice - Extra Local Numbers,https://business.forums.bt.com/t5/Phone-system/BT-Cloud-Voice-Extra-Local-Numbers/m-p/80192#M1431,"Hi,             My current issue with BT Cloud voice is that some extra local numbers I set up around October last year and were working fine, following a recent BT platform migration upgrade are not working. I have spoken to support and they will get back to me tomorrow and hopefully it will be sorted. But in the meantime, I wondered if anyone had found the same problem.             I just wanted to make some general comments about BT Cloud Voice and how we have found it since moving over from ISDN.             ISDN served us well for many years, but was not perfect. Features like call recording and logging were either not possible or very expensive to setup. Downtime could also be an issue. I can remember losing all phone for about 3 days and then sorting it out and being contacted by BT to say they had put us down for cancelation of our lines. I got to it before the lines were canceled but this was a very stressful time indeed and completely unnecessary. If I did not know better I would think someone in our BT Local Business centre took a disliking to me and put us down for cancelation.             I have BT fibre and use all BT equipment to avoid the 'it not us guv' senario.             If you are thinking of going over to BT Cloud Voice, in general, I can say it is very good, but you should expect a bit more downtime. The problem is that BT Cloud Voice is only as good as your internet connection. We get about 75 meg download and 20 meg upload so should be plenty for the five phones and five computers we use.             We use a call overflow company and one strange issue we have that continues is every now and again the phones will not ring in our office but will go through to the overflow. At least the phone does get answered but this does seem to be a problem level 1 BT Cloud Voice support cannot get to the bottom of.             I am concerned that BT Cloud Voice uses a blend of software suppliers to work. I think I noticed there is an American company supplying much of the software needed. I don't think this makes it easy for BT Cloud Voice support to get issues resolved quickly.              Another migration issue I had recently caused problems with our office 365 licenses. Email aliases were migrated into full email addresses. This produced a bill around the 1500 pound mark and I had to claim it back from BT.             BT also seems to suffer from a blend of login interfaces and accounts. Some of my contact details from 20 years ago are still showing and cannot be updated. If this is general this again must cause massive problems for those poor employees trying to deliver support.             If anyone has had similar problems and knows how to resolve please let me know. I would also like to know if failover using a mobile connection is possible?             Thank You!

Please let me know you are happy to proceed with this"".             Unfortunately, the salesperson failed to advise me that this price excluded VAT, (my current package is £32.95 inc.

Pre November 2020, had 2 phone lines with BTBusiness, one had a phone and broadband the other had just a second phone, numbers ending 761 and 764.      November 2020, got a call from bt sales and was convinced to go to the Halo VOIP system, agreed with the sales person to drop one landline as we rarley used it, we decided to drop the 761 number.      the deal was emailed through for 2 sims 1 with international calls, bt halo for the 764 number and business broadband, total quoted was £88.00 per month total, I still have the email!      Waited till january to get the equipment sen to us.      January 15th equipment arrives, set it all up but the voip dosent work and the broadband is skethcy so called bt, as id suspected the hub 5 was not great got a hub6 to replace it.      No joy, voip phone still dosent work and the broadband is still dropping one or more times a day, contact bt and they reprovision the line and send out a new handset and base station, this unsurprisingly dosent fix the problem.      rinse repeat a few times, we now have 3 handset and base stations, no landline and bills some of which are £170.00      By now ive spent hours on the phone, hours on the websites chat help desk and lost all confidence, so i request the services be rolled back, so engineer booked and a guy from kelly comunications turns up, connects the phone to an analouge line but fubars the broadband which then drops to 4g assure (atleast something actually worked!)      engineer says we would never get the voip system to work without fibre to the premises which is definately wrong. claimes he fixed everything but left us with no broadband      Engineer that came today was very puzzled that he couldnt get both bb and phone working, since weve not had a working landline since JANUARY i opted for him getting the broadband working, but he did advise the bb was on a digital line and the phone on  a analouge line and i would be paying to much, now seeing as bt hasnt at any point fulfilled their contract fully i think ive been paying to much since january , it would be great if someone from bt, a complaints handler or someone would take ownership of this, and actually make sure it got sorted because so far ive seen nothing to give me any confidence.

However the speeds I’ve been getting are terrible. Generally mornings are ok with a download speed of around 30mb but after around 1pm up until early morning it’s been averaging around 2.5mb, regularly even dropping to 0.5mb. If more than one device is connected to the WiFi it’s practically unusable, any attempt at streaming results in constant buffering and it ends up taking 20 minutes to watch 5 minutes of video. Trying to download games on Steam takes forever with the download speed peaking, on average, at 1.5mb. Considering I’m paying for up to 52mb I don’t think these speeds are acceptable. I don’t expect to be getting 52mb download speed constantly especially during peak times but what is the point in me paying for the 52mb package when I could be on the 17mb package and be getting the same speeds? An Openreach engineer visited earlier and told me there was no problems with the line but there could be a problem with the router so I could request a new one but might get charged by BT. So what is my best option here? Should I request a new router in the hope that it fixes it? Should I go out and buy my own router (suggestions on that are welcome)? Or should I just phone up and cancel it altogether because that seems like the best option at this point. Thanks in advance for any help. ",28,Nov,2020,06,shaurysaw85,Intros

I have a 24 month contract with BT          During the conversation with the lady when I asked for help fixing the ""dropping out"" issues she did mention that if the problem was an out of warranty router or a non BT router or anything other that BT issue I would be charged £245 plus vat          At no point did I think that a router sold as part of a 24 month deal would be out of warranty!
