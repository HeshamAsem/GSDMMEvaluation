Having once had a role where my company needed to educate hundreds of employees on how not to get scammed, I’d like to make a few suggestions:      Do not tell the scammer “there is no such company as BT Openreach, they became separate companies in 2017” This is just giving them information they can use in the future. If scammers keep telling people they are “BT Openreach” they are confirming they are not legitimate.      Don’t get mad with them. It will only raise your blood pressure.      Don’t blow whistles, sound claxons or make other loud noises.      Ideally, don’t engage with them at all. Just hang up.      If you want to retaliate and are not concerned about your phone being engaged for a while, ask them to hold on for a moment, then place your phone on your desk table etc and go about your business. After 15 minutes or so, pick the phone up and see if they are still there. If they are, excuse yourself again and repeat until they give up.      All the time the scammer is holding on, waiting for you, is time they are not using to scam someone else.      If you think it might be a genuine call, there is nothing wrong with    STRONG   EM you   EM    STRONG  asking  STRONG   EM  them    EM    STRONG security questions.

The telephone line to our house is run as a single separate line from the same kerbside pole to the side of our house, through the branches of the same tree. We are Sky broadband phone customers and not BT.      The tree is quite old and will at sometime probably damage both lines by either a branch coming off, abrasion of the lines or by falling down completely, my questions are around liability and avoiding potential issues.      Do I just wait until either of the lines are damaged, then let BT fix them? Would I be liable for any of the costs?        Should I pre-emptively warn BT of the possible hazard?      Would BT remove prune the tree pre-emptively ?(I don’t mind, it’s old, ugly, a bit close to the house and I could do with the firewood!)

About ten days ago, I signed up to Sky and was told that my internet would be installed on Monday 27th. . Duly on this day an Openreach operative turned up, looked at the job, and then said he'd come back later that day with a colleague and a hoist. I need a device called an ONT to connect my router up to the system.                He never came back.               He never let me know what the situation was.               I now know the issue is that you need to get a hoist.                I don't have any date for when a hoist is going to become available.                Now, I need you to have an insight into my world.                I am severely disabled and I work from home.               I have very disfigured hands and find using technology difficult.

I only joined Sky because the last owners f the house had Sky internet. I'm beginning to think this was a massive mistake.

We are about two thirds of the way there, but we need to encourage more to sign up.

I work from home full-time currently and live in a semi-rural market town in Nottinghamshire. The town has mostly appalling broadband speeds due to FTTC cabinets serving properties a substantial distance away. Apart from some random spot-upgraded properties which had nearby telephone poles upgraded making them eligible for FULL fibre to the home connectivity, the premise is these properties didn't meet a minimum speed requirement. I lived at one of these addresses which got upgraded but recently moved to another property with the same sub-par speeds (which didn't get upgraded... makes sense).      I now pay for 18-26Mbps down not too much less than what almost everyone I know pays for 5-50x the speed. Also because this is unreliable at best and not good for having a house with streaming, downloading,  conference calls and call-out responsibilities going on, I've had to get an unlimited 4G sim and an external antenna. Which isn't massively stable but tops out at around 4x the speed of my static,  cabinet connection. I'm constantly switching back and forth, I have no issues on my main-line and have had it checked by techs on the phone and in-person.      I am in dire need of an infrastructure upgrade which was similarly offered to nearby properties, I did contact the better broadband for nottinghamshire scheme showing them proof my connection fell under their schemes remit, however they just said ""well the data we have for your property disagrees"" and ended it there.       What, if anything are my options? I am a homeowner and plan to be in this residence for the foreseeable. I'm on a connection which I had much better than a decade ago. Virgin media isn't an option so I am stuck on copper from the cabinet. Can I pay for FTTH to be installed? How do I prompt an upgrade without throwing my name in some form and crossing my fingers for the next 5 years?       Any help would be massively appreciated!

My Res line has Infinity since it arrived and before that BT Internet since 1997.      A few years ago I switched my Bus line to TT for various reasons, including Call Diversion charges. A low speed Broadband was included which I never bothered to set up but last week it was announced that Infinity speed broadband would be included at no additional cost and a new Modem duly arrived.      I thought I might as well set it up...just in case...and it is free. BIG MISTAKE!!!! It needed a username and password that you get from an telephone auto service. The modem would not connect to the internet, despite the light showing it was.      Finally spoke to 2nd level support and got the WiFi working with a new password. Alas the Password from the auto generated service was wrong. After a few hours I realised the speed was 3.09 down 0.35 up. Went onto tech support chatline. Operator was USELESS and after 30 mins with her ""testing the line"" told me that the line was good but would not reveal the exchange speeds. Told me to PHONE Tech support who told me to phone another number...who do not answer the phone. MAYBE the exchange has not yet updated the speed but I have no way of doing a line profile. Meanwhile BT Infinity continues to give me 68 18 as it has nearly always done  for around 10 years and on the couple of occasions, it went ape, it was quickly restored or in one case Openreach replaced cable from the street into the house.

As I had not ordered anything from BT I was naturally suspicious. this text message invited me to click on a link to track the parcel. Naturally I did not.      This morning I received a message that the parcel would be delivered between 08:15am and 12:12pm. Again inviting me to click on a link.      At 11:36am I received a text message saying the parcel had been delivered. again inviting me to click on a link.      Unfortunately, I was out of the house during that period but a download from my security CCTV has shown That nobody had approached the house during the time I was away from the house.

I have raised this with BT and i have a complaint issued but when i was talking to the person on the live webchat, I stated we had not renewed or taken the contract out in October and his words were ""you never renewed you were provided with a contract"" I asked him what he meant and he couldn't tell me.....please someone explain to me, can people just be provided with legally binding contracts that they do not actually have to consent to?

MS advised that if enough people come forth with this issue they might be able to develop a fix for it, but at the moment there is no fix.      To be clear-the issue I am referring to is this: when I delete an email or move an email to a folder in Outlook-the action does not replicate get mirrored in my BT web based mail nor in BT Mail on my iPhone. And I have IMAP settings (BT and MS checked my settings and they are all fine).      The communication between Outlook and BT's server is no longer in existence.

I frequently consult the Community website when I get stuck on how to proceed on my computer, and am grateful when I find helpful advice, but all too often those who help seem to assume that  customers have a certain amount of existing knowledge. For example, I needed to make adjustments to my email ""safe senders"" list, and was told to begin by opening the Settings tab. But I simply could not find the latter. Eventually an online chat with a BT adviser revealed that I had to click on my email address in the right, upper, part of my email screen, which produced a drop-down containing ""settings"". From there on everything was easy.      So this aged customer would ask, with due humility, if those who are kind enough to give advice would ensure that every procedural step is described with minute detail and not to assume any level of existing knowledge by those who post enquiries.

Our BT Smart Hub 2 and TV Box arrived today.   BT confirmed they have activated the broadband and the Digital Voice phone  service so we thought we were good to go.  I didn't order the BT Digital Voice phones because we have a brand new set of phones which are simple and easy to understand.  We are pensioners after all.      Because of Digital Voice, which appeared to be obligatory - we didn't opt for it -  BT have apparently deactivated all the 'old fashioned' copper wired phone and ethernet extension sockets.  So the only place we can plug in our hub and phone base unit is the Openreach master box in the cupboard under the stairs - NOT VERY PRACTICAL!!! - especially for the phone bas unit.        Oh, and the TV box also needs to be connected to the hub, whereas the TV Aerial point, which also has to be connected, is on the living room wall on the other side of the house where you would normally expect it to be.  We'd have cables running all over the house if we tried to do this.  We've asked BT to reactivate the extension sockets and we waiting on a call to confirm this.  They have a also offered to send a Digital Voice adapter and some mini connectors.          STRONG BUT my question is - did BT actually tell Barretts who built the house (i) that the BT Openreach box should be located near the TV aerial point because everything had to be connected directly into that box and (ii) that phone and ethernet extension sockets would not be required?   STRONG         We can't use the TV service yet because we need a TV aerial - booked to be installed next week.  But we also find that there is no code for our 'Eternity' brand TV - only a few years old -  so we'll be using two different remotes for the TV and the BT TV box going forward - maybe not BT's fault but b***** annoying all the same.      Yes, I know we might not have gone with BT - our first choice was Virgin Media.  However Kelly Communications, who do their installation service, identified a problem with the ducting in the street 100m from our house in mid February and STILL haven't fixed it 2 MONTHS LATER.

Whole project looks worth pursuing, but are there any gotchas I might come across, or alternatively has anyone tried this?      Thanks ",17,Jan,2022,18,BobE1,BBinHome

I purchased it solely due to the low latency the line provides (checked a neighbour's connection who is also with BT).      After 2 weeks, interleaving was enabled, and my latency increased by around 15 ms.      A BT call was logged and an openreach engineer came out. I explained to him the issue and he performed the Line reset DLM  reset, and voila, connection back to the better latency happy days.      After another 2 weeks, interleaving switched back on (surprising really as there was only 1 powerfailure in the home and i think 1 ADSL resync at 4am). The interleaving did go to moderate on its own, but today after another powerfailuire to the ground floor in the home where the router is, interleaving again is now fully enabled.      Mods, any chance you can completely disable interleaving for me on the line? I believe it is fastpath profile (but that's just what I have read here so may be mistaken).      If there is anything I need to do can you let me know? Happy to help out or do anything to get this fixed.      Thanks,      Adam ",11,Jan,2022,20,m6,BBinHome

I wanted to connect my router to a slave socket in an understairs cupboard.      The house was a new build 20 years ago and I ran CAT5 cabling throughout including a length of CAT5 from the back of the Master socket to the understairs cupboard.      Download speed with router connected to the Master socket test socket is 23 Mbs. (Faceplate removed)      Speed with router connected via faceplate connection is 15 Mbs.      The blue white and White blue of CAT5 cable are connected to terminals 2 and 5 respectively. In the understairs cupboard they are not connected to anything!      If I disconnect the 2 blue wires from the master socket and plug the router into the faceplate download speed is about 20Mbs.      If I connect a single wire to terminal 2 (only one wire connected)  the download speed falls to 18Mbs.      If I connect the second wire to terminal 5 the download speed falls to 15Mbs.      If I use any other pair of wires in the CAT5 cable the speed via the faceplate is 15Mbs.      In short, if I connect any wire to terminals 2 and 5, even if the cores have no connection at the other end under the stairs, the download speed is reduced from about 23Mbs to 15Mbs      How can this be rectified if I want a slave socket for my router to be connected to somewhere else in the house?

My Home Hub 3 was hacked, somehow, by someone in Ghana. So I unplugged it. I’d been given a Smart Hub 2 last year, when my contract was renewed. I didn’t use it, as I wasn’t that impressed with the size and build, and more than satisfied with the Home Hub 3 which was working reasonably okay (over 7 years I’ve had it), till it was hacked. And even if it had been useable still, I disconnected it and plugged the new Smart Hub 2 in.      I have a ASDL Copper connection. I’m 5 miles from the BT Cabinet because I live in the middle of nowhere.      When I first plugged in the Smart Hub 2 around the end of August, beginning of September it was working fine, perfectly. At about 1.7 mbps. And then I switched over from Halo, to the new Home Essentials contract because I’m not rich. And on disability.      It was all okay, until the weekend of the 24th September, when my internet just started to play up, continually disconnect. Nothing has changed in my life, no new gadgets. Etc. It dropped 1000 times over 4 days. On that weekend. Which is just ridiculous.     l’ve had two engineers out. Had a new Smart Hub (Home Hub 6) sent out, packed up the Smart Hub 2 to send back. Still it’s just going from one speed to another… From the highest ever today at 2.06 mbps to 0.94 mbps.     When on my Home Hub 3 it was always around the 1.40-1.60 mbps range.     Am I seriously going to have to buy a second hand Home Hub 3, or is there something the engineers are not picking up, because I’ve not changed a thing, and I’ve been using my iPad mini 4 happily with my Home Hub 3 since last May when I got a new iPad.     I changed the router to just use the one wifi channel to 2.4 GHz, like my Home Hub 3. But it’s still not working correctly, the swing is too great between speeds.

First my broadband and phone line stopped working when Openreach carried out the work. Then on the day that was fixed my speeds were very low. My phone line is quite long, around 4 KM to 4.1 KM and my attenuation with ADSL2+ with other providers including Be Broadband and later Sky who purchased my Be* account, has been around 52 to 53 dB while on ADSL2+. I used to use ADSL2 which gave an attenuation of around 49 dB 49.5dB and around 7 Mbps down and 1.31 Mbps up. The upload on Sky dropped to 606 Kbps and then rose to 798 Kbps.      On the day that Openreach fixed my line, they had to swap it saying the original line was dead, I got around 5.5 Mbps down and 448 Kbps up which is well under half the speed for upload that I was expecting. While asking about this on a broadband forum someone noticed that my modulation is G992.1 which is ADSL ADSLMax and not the ADSL2+ which my account was meant to be. ADSL2+ has been at the Kings Norton telephone exchange since around 2007.             I did telephone BT and spoke to a woman about this but she could not fix it after doing some tests and asking me to reset the Smart Hub 2, it is still stuck on G992.1. I have tried my own router, an old IPv4 Speedtouch which has always worked well on my long line but despite having a tool (DMT tool) which can change the modulation it will never sync at anything higher than G992.1.      Can someone please fix this? Below are two very similar threads where it was fixed by RobbieMac.

My parents live in the country, at the end of a 6 mile copper wire.  To our knowledge their speed has always been around 0.5mbps at best which they had resigned themselves to years ago as it was just about enough to meet their needs.      They've had literally dozens of issues over the past 8 years and each time an engineer comes out and says they’ve fixed it, which lasts a varying amount of time. This time, however, they have been without internet for 5 weeks (it has occasionally randomly come on at times, but never for more than 48 hours). They’ve had every inch of the cabling from the hub all the way back to the exchange checked, 6 engineers called out (2 didn’t show), new hub (they had a 2.0 and on changing it the internet stopped again!), they had an open reach ‘expert’ last Friday who said the issue was that the signal being sent down the line was too weak to sustain a reliable connection at the house, the further down the line the speeds just drop, however if BT were to change the connection to a stronger - 24mbps - connection at the exchange it would help.      BT say this isn’t possible. Literally ‘computer says no’.      My dad has taken 6 days of annual leave waiting for calls or engineers to visit. Every single advisor has a different story and claims what the last one told them is wrong. In one day alone they had over 5000 dropouts!           They know there’s nothing wrong with the line. They’d be happy with 1mbps!! If BT aren’t providing the minimum of 1-3mbps then surely they shouldn’t be paying?      Where can they go from here? ",10,May,2021,21,Weekailz,BBinHome

46,Slow Broadband Speed intermittently!!,https://community.bt.com/t5/ADSL-Copper-broadband/Slow-Broadband-Speed-intermittently/m-p/2155987#M279047,"Hi. Thanks for reading this post.      I have a HH2 and a copper connection. At least once a week my download speed drops to well below 1     Megabits per second, which is very      frustrating. I have complained to BT a number of times without success.      I am hoping a fellow forum user can assist me in case the settings are wrong on my modem, I have tried changing modems as I have a spare HH, and also all the cables &amp amp  filers, I have also moved my router close to the BT wallplug rather that the previous wired connection, and connect via Wifi to no help.      I believe I can pay for a BT Engineer to check my system out, is this a worthwhile option?

51,Speeds dropping to 0.13Mbps at nightime peak periods,https://community.bt.com/t5/ADSL-Copper-broadband/Speeds-dropping-to-0-13Mbps-at-nightime-peak-periods/m-p/2153403#M278997,"Reading about users not being able to stream makes me laugh. We can never do that at any time.      I was one of the first in the area, (1980’s), to have the internet, old dial up system, perfectly adequate for information gathering, and emails. Then when adsl arrived, it was more than good enough with considerable speed increase. We are about 2 miles from the exchange, but speeds have always been adequate. 2 years ago a new housing estate was built between us and the exchange, and from then on speeds have fallen rapidly. When it is good, speeds are at a maximum of 3.16 Mbps download, and 0.35 Mbps upload, which is adequate. At night and during peak times, speeds will drop to 0.13 Mbps and 2.73Mbps upload, so we can’t look at emails or do banking at those speeds. I am annoyed that BT have been pushing people to sign up for films and TV on the internet without upgrading the infrastructure. So we are now paying higher prices for ADSL which is often not up to the old dial up speeds.      Looking at our speed results it would seem that upload speeds are high, because our modem is applying full power from our end of the line, while the exchange, to cope with the surge in users, is pushing up the switching speed to the point where the’ on’ period of the signal is too short to overcome the line attenuation before it switches off again. So our signal strength drops away till it goes below the critical point. Am I wrong to find this unacceptable. BT says it’s because of the line length, but we have always had the same line length, so why is it suddenly a problem now? Unless for the reasons above.      Is it impossible for BT to boost the signal? We do that on long private networks. Or can’t they slow down the switching speed, by grouping the longer lines together and switching them at a slower speed? It seems very unfair that we are paying for a service which is not what it used to be, yet still being changed the same price as those TV and streaming habits are causing the problem.

Background: I have an EO line, about 500m from the Exchange, even though most of my neighbours are on FTTC.  My line had to be switched at the pole by an Openreach engineer in December when I had connection dropping issues.  Since then I've taken a number of steps to improve my internal connection to the router - it is now on a 50cm shielded cable connected to an ADSL faceplate on the master socket.  My line attenuation is down to 13dbs and noise margin up to 18.5 downstream (and a quiet line test is absolutely quiet).      I'm only getting 14.34Mbps data rate, despite a maximum rate of 22564.  My IP Profile is resolutely stuck at 12.65Mbps.  I would hope, based on the line margin figures, that I would be getting at least 3Mbps more.

Anway, that is a rant for a different day :)......             So when i do the uso checker, BT tells me my solution is a 4g connection. I see that BT now do unlimited 4g broadband, great! Was hoping to change my adsl contract to a 4g one.       However, I cant order the 4g as it says the signal is too weak in my area!? So BT are telling me that 4g will fufill the uso requirement, yet i cant get it because the signal is too weak? I am at a loss as to what to do.      Would it be correct to suggest that BT should let me out of my contract without penalty as they cant provide the 4g?      This would leave me free to go to a different 4g provider which can fufill the uso.

79,Taking BT to small claims court,https://community.bt.com/t5/ADSL-Copper-broadband/Taking-BT-to-small-claims-court/m-p/2139542#M278722,"Hi all. I've read through some related posts back in 2017 but didn't really find it much use as everyone on there already had speeds I can only dream of.       Long story short...      In 2017 I was guaranteed a speed of 2mb. Thing's were reasonable and I was actually receiving nearer 6mb which was just about enough for what I needed it for.  This never really fluctuated much and the connection was pretty stable.      Since then they have dropped the guaranteed speed to 1mb which is just ridiculous. I'm told my minimum guaranteed upload speed is.... wait for it.... 0mb. The line is dropping anywhere up to 28 times a day when I'm told 4 is the real maximum that is acceptable. My current speeds peak at just below 2mb but during peak hours this can be as low as around 0.5mb. Pictures don't load as the upload is so slow and I can barely stream video in 480p, let alone do a zoom meeting.       So after wasting more time than I can actually fathom trying to resolve this I'm told this is acceptable. Engineers have been out to my house and open reach have dug up half the road fixing a fault they supposedly found but it made no difference at all, in fact I think they may have even made it worse as before hand I was actually getting closer to 3mb!      I've been to the ombudsmen but other than 1 email dating 2017 stating my minimum guaranteed speed of 2mb I simply have no evidence. The decision is soon to be made but ultimately I think it's just been more of my time wasted and I think the resolution will be a goodwill gesture of £60 which just doesn't help me at all.       So I'm left thinking about small claims court. I have recorded (with their acknowledgement) a near 2hr phone call from BT and in the recording is all the evidence I feel I need. We talked about my line dropping non stop, and the fact that my minimum speed guarantee has been purposefully dropped, most likely to stop me pursuing a complaint as it still meets their criteria.       I'm not trying to gain money for poor service, I simply want to get back to the speeds I know the line is capable of. I'm a mile from the exchange and I believe the copper cable is degrading faster than they can repair it. There is a lot of noise on my line and I believe that BT are simply ignoring the situation as it's not in their interest to fix.      There are no other options for me in terms of 4g mobile broadband etc so I'm left paying £30 a month for a 1mb connection. We won't be getting fiber for years yet and with technology moving the speed it is I'm already feeling left behind.      Has anyone had any similar experiences or had any luck going to small claims?      Any help or advice is welcome as I'm at the end of my tether. ",06,Feb,2021,16,My1mbconnection,BBinHome

I would love my router to be located in my kitchen which is in a central location and where the best connection is required. Would it be better to have a telephone extension socket installed in my kitchen, which would be easy as wires could be run through the walls which are accessible at the moment.

Occasionally I get to speak to someone who seems to know what they are talking about, but always seems to be transferred to another department.  Then, I'm on hold for a while and either get cut off, put back to the main call desk or am transferred to the totally wrong department.      I called the Ofcom's Universal Service Obligation team as I should be able to receive a minimum of 10Mbps download and 1Mbps upload. I then had to contact BT again to discuss options. I was told that I need to speak to the 4G Team. I was then cut-off eventually.        I see from the BT website that there is a 4G Home Broadband option available (although the cost if extortionate). However, what I would prefer is an option where I can use 4G or landline broadband depending on which is fastest (and available). Sometimes the 4G signal is not available, so I would like the broadband to automatically switch to the broadband line inn this case.  I know that this is possible (BT have 4g Assure which seems to do exactly this, but is only available to business broadband).        I know that there are other 4G options available (at cheaper prices).  I would need an unlimited package however, as I and my family are working from home and are using the broadband for most of the day.

95,Speeds dropping to 0.13Mbps at nightime peak periods,https://community.bt.com/t5/ADSL-Copper-broadband/Speeds-dropping-to-0-13Mbps-at-nightime-peak-periods/m-p/2130018#M278546,"Reading about users not being able to stream makes me laugh. We can never do that at any time.      I was one of the first in the area, (1980’s), to have the internet, old dial up system, perfectly adequate for information gathering, and emails. Then when adsl arrived, it was more than good enough with considerable speed increase. We are about 2 miles from the exchange, but speeds have always been adequate. 2 years ago a new housing estate was built between us and the exchange, and from then on speeds have fallen rapidly. When it is good, speeds are at a maximum of 3.16 Mbps download, and 0.35 Mbps upload, which is adequate. At night and during peak times, speeds will drop to 0.13 Mbps and 2.73Mbps upload, so we can’t look at emails or do banking at those speeds. I am annoyed that BT have been pushing people to sign up for films and TV on the internet without upgrading the infrastructure. So we are now paying higher prices for ADSL which is often not up to the old dial up speeds.      Looking at our speed results it would seem that upload speeds are high, because our modem is applying full power from our end of the line, while the exchange, to cope with the surge in users, is pushing up the switching speed to the point where the’ on’ period of the signal is too short to overcome the line attenuation before it switches off again. So our signal strength drops away till it goes below the critical point. Am I wrong to find this unacceptable. BT says it’s because of the line length, but we have always had the same line length, so why is it suddenly a problem now? Unless for the reasons above.      Is it impossible for BT to boost the signal? We do that on long private networks. Or can’t they slow down the switching speed, by grouping the longer lines together and switching them at a slower speed? It seems very unfair that we are paying for a service which is not what it used to be, yet still being changed the same price as those TV and streaming habits are causing the problem.

Apologies, I realise these are dreadful times and everyone is very much grappling with difficult circumstances but as our poor broadband has meant that we have sadly had to inform the school our children won’t be joining any online education this is something I would really appreciate assistance with if anyone has the time.           In summary:      We live in a rural area. We are connected to Exchange ‘XXX’ cabinet 2 and like everyone else near us connected to this cabinet have very poor broadband speeds (Max 7Mb). The cabinet Downstream line rate mbps is detailed as High:20.8 Mbps.       My nearest neighbour left and my nearest neighbour right is also connected to Exchange ‘XXX’ but to cabinet 4 and has good broadband speed (45-55Mb). The cabinet Downstream rate is detailed as High: 80 Mbps.           It seems pot luck as to which household is connected to which cabinet and as neighbours are aware of this there is no appetite for a Community Fibre Partnership - there is confusion and resentment rather than community spirit.  If people understood why some neighbours had faster internet than others it would greatly help.

97,Continuous Resets of SmartHub2: Copper Broadband,https://community.bt.com/t5/ADSL-Copper-broadband/Continuous-Resets-of-SmartHub2-Copper-Broadband/m-p/2128883#M278536,"Beginning yesterday morning I experienced a recurrence of an occasional problem with my copper broadband, which is that the hub repeatedly resets. If I am lucky it eventually stabilises with an acceptable downstream speed just a little below what I typically get, but with an absurdly low upstream speed, usually of  64 kbit s.      I am virtually certain that the cause is a noisy line, and indeed some noise is audible on the PSTN phone. Unfortunately however the problem is intermittent, albeit ongoing typically for several hours at a time, and bitter experience has proven that BT cannot cope with intermittent faults. I phoned the fault in yesterday and was offered an engineer visit, but I fear that the fault would not oblige by manifesting itself during an engineer visit, and therefore decided instead that fault should simply to be logged pending another call. And yesterday evening I managed to get a stable hub with an upstream speed of about 256 kbit s, so the severity of whatever fault is causing the problem had presumably reduced. Sadly however the reduction was temporary and the problem returned sometime this morning.      Although the problem has occurred before it has not done so for many months, if not a year or more, and I suspect that something unusual is happening. I'm therefore posting to see if anyone can shed any light on what might be going on. In particular does a noisy line always indicate a problem with the line itself, or might electrical interference from someone using electrical equipment be responsible? Put another way, is this problem necessarily with BT's network?      Also, can cold weather, and possibly damp cause problems such as this? I've always considered that copper broadband is more likely to fail in hot weather because of any dry joints expanding, and even if it continues working its performance might be worse than usual because of increased electrical resistance. Perhaps this is too simplistic a view however.      I'm also puzzled as to why a problematic level of noise should affect the upstream speed more seriously than the downstream speed.      I'm happy to try and post hub stats if this might help, though I don't know whether I can access them when the problem is at its worse. ",08,Jan,2021,15,FrustratedCustomer68,BBinHome

Short story: Broadband keeps dropping out, but the BT Troubleshooter shows no faults, so it won't let me book an engineer.       Long version: I'm 1.3KM from my roadside cab. This cab is missing one of it's doors and is usually full of leaves, rain and a big mess of cables...      I was on a FTTC connection (12Mbps down, 1Mbps up) but the stability was very poor and I couldn't connect to video conferincing calls or Teamviewer, so I downgraded to the standard copper connection. This has proved to be slightly slower, but a lot more stable over the distance. I now get 8Mbps download, and 0.54Mbps upload, it's been slow but I can just about hold a call or a Teamviewer session (but not both!).      Over the past few weeks my connection started dropping out for a couple of mins once or twice a day. The HH5 lights cycle through red and orange and it finally connects up again without help. It's getting worse and worse now, and it now drops out for 5-20 mins at a time, and this occurs circa 10 times per day.      Just to add to the mix, I'm now working from home full time and doing volenteer IT Support for a local school, and have two children at online school...      The incoming line goes to the master socket only, there's no extensions and no internal phone wiring. Master socket is right by the door, and is a Master Socket 5C that was replaced 8 months ago. I've plugged into the test point but it makes no difference. I've rebooted the router, left it off overnight, factory reset it. My laptop is cabled straight in with a Cat6 lead.      When I run the BT Troubleshooter it shows as no fault, even if the HH5 is flashing red for the full duration of the test. So, I can't book an engineer test and my phonecalls go unanswered (TBH after an hour on hold I gave up).      This is truly the long version!      What can be done?

1,Broadband restricted speed?,https://community.bt.com/t5/BT-Fibre-broadband/Broadband-restricted-speed/m-p/2223533#M335701,Hello. I’ve got BT Fibre 2. Had it for years. No issues. Until recently. Up until about a month ago I was consistently getting 75Mbps down and 18 Mbps up. As reported by my Sam Knows Whitebox and an occasional test through MyBT. Now it’s 60Mbps down and 18 up. Not a dramatic decrease but just wondering why? Quiet line test fine. The only thing I can think of is that I’ve  just been doing some decorating in the hall and perhaps unplugging the hub probably more than I should. Could it’ve upset DLM - Or whatever it is that monitors the connection. If that’s the case how long must I wait for my normal service to be resumed. I’ve looked at the hub admin and it shows a possible 75Mbps. Can I ask the 150 team to restore it? Realising of course that a refusal often offends. Thanks ,28,Mar,2022,14,pddco,BTInfinity

When I signed up to BT in 2018, my upload speeds were around 7mbps.     I’m just wondering what could have caused the upload speeds to drop like they have, but not changed the download speeds? The screenshots of tests I have from when I signed up to BT are on a Wi-Fi connection, but I got similar, if not better results when I tested on a wired connection then too. I still get similar results between wired and Wi-Fi now.     I use the Ookla speed test app on my phone and the Ookla website on the desktop computer.

Finding out how digital voice works was a massive negative and a backward step in my opinion. I chose to use my old BT guardian phones instead of the digital voice ones.      Yesterday I got up and my hub has a solid purple light. I have the EE hybrid which ensures I have an internet connection. Just checked my speed, download speed 0.6 Mbps, upload 0.5mbps. So basically it's **bleep**. I have the EE box connected to the hub using an ethernet connection but it's not in an ideal spot. I have tried to move it to various places around the house using its wifi but I can not get a signal.       The main problem is that my wife is a mobile hairdresser and the phone line is down, so she is not receiving any calls for appointments. She does not give her mobile number out to customers. I take it the digital phone would not work also?      They are sending me a mini-hub today but I would have thought that it would be the same as the EE hybrid thing?      I have looked at call divert but from what I can see I need my phone to work to activate it, is this correct?      I have an engineer coming on Monday to look at the hub problem.      I am seriously considering using the 14 days change my mind option and cancelling my deal.

Unfortunately, it looks like Openreach have messed up inputting addresses onto their database, such that I am unable to find my correct address despite the fact that there are some make-believe addresses at my postcode that are suspiciously similar (think XXX Crescent, which exists next door at a neighbouring postcode, rather than XXX Street - even though the majority of the addresses at the postcode are input correctly as XXX Street!). I am thus unable to complete an order.      My questions are threefold:      1) How can I get Openreach to correct this? I'm currently being bounced around their teams with very little response - I do have a case number with their ""FTTP new sites escalations team"" but have yet to actually hear from them.      2) Can BT assist with this in any way, or are they wholly dependent on Openreach correcting their addresses beforehand?      3) Do I have a hamster's chance in hell to sort this out in ten days (half of which are weekend)?

Here goes.      I live at number 43, it is a semi detached and the other house is 44. These homes were demolished 4 years ago and rebuilt in a smaller foot print, this was due to other homes being built around us. We retained the numbers 43 and 44.      Before the demolition the internet speed available according the bt.com was Fibre1 31-36mb, they tore down the pole and routed all new cables through trunking to the cabinet.      Now when i do a line check to see how fast of broadband i can buy i am still stuck at Fibre 31-36mb, however number 44 seems to be able to get Fibre1 44-51mb, however on the other side of me (They juggled around the house numbers) 1A through 20B (New builds also) they are able to get Fibre2 (51-73mb) and i have spoken to them and they are indeed on Fibre2 connection.      All properties are on the same cabinet, the same distance (bar 20m) and all built in the same year.      So am i right in thinking the Openreach database has not been updated to reflect the change in wiring? (i think the old building had degraded copper, where as new cables were installed recently)      I recently had an pen reach engineer out for another reason and they said i can sync at 40 per my paid connection and there is no reason why we can't get Fibre2 (72mb)      So who do i talk to and what terminology am i required to use to address this issue?

51,Wish they would connect me already.,https://community.bt.com/t5/BT-Fibre-broadband/Wish-they-would-connect-me-already/m-p/2220883#M335353,"Hello readers.      So I made the decision to ditch Virgin Media for a faster connection with better prices, I ordered BT FTTP 900 on 2nd of February. I cancelled my service with Virgin a month and a half ago which ended on the 4th of March. On the 4th of March the Openreach FTTP installer came as promised, he installed and wired up everything, took the cable down the length of the drainpipe (I'm in a top floor flat) and along to the black box connection point only to find out that the red light on the modem, red light is solid on LOS. He went down to the front door of the flats, went up his ladder and tested out the black box above the door. It seems that the ones that are connected to it have signal, but the empty sockets have no signal at all, hence red light on LOS when connecting my cable. He thinks it could be to do with a splitter in the pit, under the pavement (why was it not all connected to begin with? Why did they not check it was all working in the month that it took before the install date?). I called BT on my phone in the evening of the 4th and explained it all to the lady, she sent out a 4g EE wireless mini hub which arrived on Sunday 6th, problem is it is far too slow to be able to allow myself and my partner to be working at the same time (its an old solid stone building so the signal is weak and it is only a 30mb connection ), resulting in stress and loss of income. The lady on the phone said she would get the phoenix team to look in to it which should be within the next 5 working days. Well, needless to say, here we are on the 13th and still solid red light on LOS on modem. Can I please be connected so I can wake up from this nightmare?       Thanks.

I am looking at getting FTTP and have been told it’s easy - OpenReach will come out and sort it.           P          P         However, my current layout I think will make it difficult. Internet comes in from underground near my front door, and then the master socket is in an internal wall. I’ve read that they just drill through so the FTTP internal panel sits on an external wall, but I have no power sockets anywhere near where it currently comes in on the ground (and honestly, no where else is really a suitable place for it to go - the master socket location is perfect).           P          P         I read that they can pull the fibre cable through using the existing copper, however my friend had this done and the copper snapped, so has ended up with the connection in a really bad place. (Diagram below).           P          P         Making it more tricky, is that cleverly someone had an AC unit put outside right next to the current cable in area (pictures shown). I don’t think this is going to make anything possible, but I could be wrong?

We've recently moved house, and prior to moving I checked if I was able to move my current fibre broadband package over to the new property to save the hassle of setting up a new connection etc. The move home system said I was able to move the package over with no issues, so we commenced the move and awaited activation. (We moved on the 11th Feb, internet live date the 21st of Feb).      The 21st came around and we had no internet, I rang BT and was told there was an outage and it should be live by 9AM the following morning. Next morning.. still no internet. We rang BT and an engineer was sent out the following day - apparently we had been linked to the wrong cabinet in the village and needed to be reconnected to a correct one.      For next 2 weeks we went through the cease &amp amp  re-provide fiasco with constant delays and issues, and finally was told that fibre isn't available and we can only have a copper connection that runs at ~5mbps.      The problem is I run a business using a cloud based fileserver that requires constant access to large design files, and my partner works at home in the pensions industry, and if we would have known there was a fibre issue we would have never moved, as it is integral to our livelihood.       Looking into the issue further, numerous people in the village have access to fibre, even the previous occupant of the house was offered fibre when she set up her own connection. Additionally,  I have spoken to someone who had a fibre connection, sold their house &amp amp  moved 5 doors down on the same street, and then didn't have fibre available.      I'm at a loss at what to do as BT technical support isn't being much help. The ADSL checker reads as linked, and apparently has shown the same data for months.      The main exchange to the village has FTTC, and the business part on the edge of the village has superfast live. Additionally when checking on fibre availability &amp amp  Superfast North Yorkshire, they all say fibre   STRONG should   STRONG  be available, but when you go through further into the order process it flags up an error.

Rang up again to today to be told its been a steady 5mb s for months, which is simply untrue as the last subcontracted engineer tested it straight from the outlet at 2.3.          There must be something that can be done to either get out of the contract or make the speeds usable. Ofcom and the govt state 10mb s is deemed as usable in the right to a decent connection movement. Yet when I brought this up BT said, if its that slow its that slow.           Anyone have any experience going down that route, or in a position similar to myself?

The building has ethernet cable installed so I thought I could attach the OTP connection into the RJ45 wall socket in the bedroom and plug into the WAN socket on the router where the ethernet cable ends. But the EE smart hub doesn't connect.      This method works if I connect the smart hub local to the OTP and then take a LAN cable to the wall socket, but that means I need the router in the bedroom........any clues what is wrong ?

For the first 3 months I was getting approx 275mbps and it was working flawlessly. Then the fault happened, with ping of up to 3000ms and download speed as low as 500kbs. Then 15 seconds later back to 275mbps. Was very sporadic with no pattern. Could be randomly throughout the day, or even all day sometimes.      After 5 weeks of calling BT and 2 escalations, the engineer has connected me to a new socket.  So far, no 3000ms ping and remains constant (although it's only been about 3 hours since and the problem was rather intermittent so we'll see) But right now my speed is consistently 220-235mbps with 3ms ping. Now this is much better than the past few weeks but overall...it isn't like it's 3000 ping anymore. but this is worse than before the fault even happened.      I know the stay fast guarantee is 150mbps but from a customer perspective. I used to be getting 275mbps. And now after circumstances not at my fault, my speeds are lower than what they used to be and the engineers have not succeeded in bringing my speeds back up to ""normal"" rather, just above the stay fast guarantee. Will BT do anything if it's still technically above 150mbps? It affects me the most as I will be setting up a business hosting servers so a lot of bandwidth will be needed.  40mbps is quite a big drop and I'm rather disappointed with BT and how the whole situation was handled considering my house is fully capable of achieving the full 275mbps. It also took me 5 weeks to get hold of openreach. Ridiculous!      I've been paying for this contract and haven't even been able to use it! and because the broadband wasn't completely out I'm not even entitled to any compensation ",07,Mar,2022,16,stuartgf,BTInfinity

I’m disappointed in the suggested decrease in speed as I’m not over the moon with my current speed and was putting up until the contract enabled me to move.  I’ve tried to see what else is available at the new address and it seems there aren’t any major competitors- both Sky and Virgin draw a blank via their websites.

I got Fibre 900 installed today as my previous speeds were around 50mbps download and 20 upload. MGALs when I upgraded was 700mbps download and, for the price difference, i felt it was worth it.      At one point today, my wireless download went to just over 150mbps and upload was around 120. I've now did a speed test using OOKLA and I'm sitting with a measly 46mbps downloaded however the upload is sitting at 65. I know there's usually a period of time for the speeds to settle (10 days I believe). Having spoken to people who recently had it installed, they said their wireless speeds were 400 500+ after the first day of installation. Is this normal to see the speeds even lower with FTTP 900 than when I was on regular fibre? Obviously I know if I ring tech support they will likely tell me to monitor it over the next 10 days I'd imagine for the speeds to settle optimize.             Thanks.

After a month of help from the Executive Resolutions team and waiting . . . it finally got sorted and I ordered Fibre.      Yesterday was installation day! Whoopee… ah no. MJ Quinn turned up (2 engineers) and said no. They needed traffic management to do the job as the new fibre line comes over the road from the pole directly opposite my home.      I pointed out to them that they did to TWO installations for flats right next door and that was done by one engineer making a new attachment on the property and then connecting a drop to the CBT. Then the second engineer stopped the traffic with hi-vis and the first one ran over with the drop and up the ladder and connected.      They weren’t having it. They said they’d be breaking the rules if they were caught by the ‘auditor’ who is going round checking. I said did anyone do a survey? No.      I asked them to escalate back to their managers and tell them that there is a process discrepancy here and to get it rectified.      Tried contacting Openreach today who told me to talk to BT. I did that yesterday and via the Executive Resolutions team. No joy there either.

I've also shared my experience further down...          Anyone using VDSL FTTC wanting to switch to a 3rd party router, these are the settings should your modem require one:     VLAN-ID Tag: 101     PBit: 0     VPI: 0     VCI: 35     Encapsulation: PPPoE     Authentication: CHAP      If you have static IP,  using the Broadband userid and password provided instead of the default (  A href=""mailto:btbusinesshub@business.btclick.com,"" target=""_blank"" btbusinesshub@business.btclick.com,   A  no password) is advised.      As for my experience:     I run a small business with a couple of satellite office and folks working from home. Neither we nor any of our employees used BT until Monday after a wave of insanity hit me and I decided to save a couple of hundred pounds a year by switching to BT Business for 2 sites.  We switched on Monday and its been 4 days of pain,  only alleviated by discarding all the BT provided equipment this afternoon.  So no Cloud Voice either, and no ""Hybrid backup"".      There were no positives.      Here are the negatives I encountered:     BT Business Smart Hub 2's cannot route, even after upgrading to the current firmware     v0.19.01.01105-BT.  There is a reason they call it Hub rather than router!  You can set a limited number of routes (to all RFC 1918 addresses except 10.0.0.0) but they only work for the Hub, almost.  Its not a router.  If you use its DHCP, the default route is to the router - no static routes to your VPN are given out, no ICMP redirects for internal hosts to your VPN or any other  local network+router, and no routing to them either.          You lose around 5% line speed in the DSL connection and large uploads kill downloads.  For WiFi, you cannot split the SSID between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, nor customise the guest SSID nor set a password for it, and WiFi is measurably slower than the two other manufacturers I used previously (and now use again).  You only have a choice of 3 channels fo 2.4Ghz and 4 for 5Ghz (there are 24 wireless networks in one of the buildings, which requires a delicate choice). You cannot login to the Hub externally. You cannot customise your internal domain name. You cannot assign a host a static IP addresses (i.e IPv4 address to a MAC address) until that host is on the network (i.e. you  have to let DHCP give it an address from the pool, then fix it to an IP address)               The GUI is poor.  Adding DNS host names and routes is only permissible 1 at a time.  i.e. Add+Save is required.  You can add multiple and then save, but it does not actually save.               So whatever I saved on the monthly fees I lost over the course of the last 4 days (plus time+cost travelling between offices to reset Hubs, change settings, etc).

In the attached photos you can see how the cable has been left coining in to the house and the protruding nails on the outside of the house.

BT has the licence we need as BT customers but  BT Tech say they don't know what the Norton licence number is, and even if they did they would not give it to me because it belongs to BT.!!               I am getting increasingly worried now that I won't be able to update, and am asking if anyone else is having this problem?  I am using a desktop pc with Windows 10.                 On 7th February I was told  to wait for an email from BT saying ""switch to Norton"" and if I don't get it soon contact the fault department.  I've not had any email,  but according to the letter we can update anytime from January 2022 it says nothing about waiting for an email!   Another Tech told me just to keep checking weekly to try to update and see if the message changes -  I have and it hasn't.               Please guys can you help me with this?

I have never been able to connect via broadband                My brother and I share a property, we're both 50+, he's in control of the Internet and neither of us like the other and have not spoken for years.  Childish, I know, but I don't need your input on that topic, thank you!  But hence why I always connected to the Internet via the free Wifi app.               A day ago my brother upgraded from whatever router he had to this SmartHub2 device.  While I was initially able to connect via broadband although NOT via Wifi, I am aware that he has blocked my devices restricting me from accessing the Internet.           I've limited data, and frankly don't understand how BT can claim access to WiFi hotspots if access can be restricted by an individual.      Please can someone help  🥴 ",11,Mar,2022,08,Scudder,BBOut

We have recently moved address and have a new BT Smart Hub up and running.  At our last address I was able to opt out of BT wi-fi by calling BT and they were able to do it whilst I was on the phone.  By the next day our router was no longer broadcasting the BT wi-fi signal, which is what I wanted, and it remained like that until we moved.  When we got the new hub up and running at our new address I noticed there was a very strong BT wifi signal so I assumed that I needed to opt out again to turn the signal off.  I checked the instructions on the BT webpage ""How do I opt out of BT Wi-fi?"" but when I logged into My BT and Manage BT wifi webpage  I am only given the option of signing up to BT Wifi.  So I rang the BT helpline to find out how I opt out of BT Wifi again and to get the signal turned off.  I had a very frustrating half hour call with 2 helpline assistants who didn't seem to understand what I was requesting.  One of them finally told me that what I was asking for was not possible - she said they could only turn off my entire Wi-fi signal, they couldn't just turn off the BT Wifi.  I am sure this was incorrect information as I was able to opt out before and BT's own website gives instructions for this (although I am not able to use these instructions as they dont correspond to what I see when I follow them).

Anyhoos....      I have a couple of questions regarding BTCloud with Photos and ALbums etc.      Simple one - if I delete any of the automatically generated albums that the Cloud created as I uploaded pics, does it delete the actual photos within that album ? I've tested the theory and it looks like deleting an Album DOESNT delete the images - they still appear to exist in the ALL section - but am just asking the question for confirmation.      My larger issue is that I dont seem to be able to see any details for the images on the cloud - no datestamp, timestamp, file size etc - if I RIGHT-CLICK i just get the menu associated to the browser (FORWARD   BACK INSPECT etc). Is it possible to see ""DETAILS"" of the image somehow ?      Finally - there is a DATE SLIDER function along the top of page to filter the results to within the 2 dates chosen on the slider bar... which would be GREAT if mine didnt go back to Year 0 ! So years 2000 - 2022 occupy a space about 2mm in width on the slider - which is unusable - and I think its because I have some pics that do not have a timestamp - so they are registered as being YEAR 0 - making my slider bar VERY Long and useless - am I able to alter the timestamp on the images manually so I can bring them into the current decade ?             I'm guessing I could download the ""undated"" pics to my PC, alter their timestamp... delete the originals on the cloud and re-upload these with timestamps...

In an attempt to raise the quality of wifi, I have been persuaded to try BT Wifi Discs providing mesh connectivity. This seemed attractive not least because I have - step by step - been provided with four discs within the standard rental. I might add that I am served by fibre to the house which normally gives me a speed at the router of 140 Mbps - and which remains around an entirely adequate 60   80 Mbps from the Wifi discs on the first floor.                    Unfortunately, I have one wing of the house where the physical configuration (distance, position of power sockets and masonry walls) has proved too challenging for the convenient and efficient placing of Wifi discs. I have been visited by a BT adviser who was extremely helpful but did not entirely solve the problem. In these circumstances, my two related questions are these:                BLOCKQUOTE      (a) Is it possible that the wifi signal distributed via a powerline by my Solwise AV2 Homeplug extender could be picked up by a BT Wifi disc and diffused further?         (b) If not, is it possible I could connect a BT Wifi Disc by cable to my Solwise AV2, using the ethernet sockets on each product, and then diffuse a wifi signal passed along a power line from the router and then via an ethernet cable to be radiated by the BT Wifi disc?

5,Port forwarding not working,https://community.bt.com/t5/Home-setup-Wi-Fi-network/Port-forwarding-not-working/m-p/2223167#M195185,"I run an asterisk based phone system for personal use with several extensions, a couple on the local network, 1 on my mobile and a couple of physical IP phones elsewhere for remote access allowing one phone number to essentially follow me around.      With the previous smarthub it was working perfectly fine, however a smarthub2 was sent out and a demand for the old one to be returned was issued. Initially the smart hub 2 worked as the previous one with the port forwarding rules allowing remote extensions to register, however in the last few days, port 5060 is showing closed according to services such as canyouseeme and yougetsignal, and phones accessing through the external address are unable to register on the server.      I am confident it is not an issue with my server as registrations work fine internally, and no settings have been changed on it between it working externally and stopping working externally.      Basically, I need port 5060 of my public IP to forward to port 5060 of internal device 192.168.1.65. forwarding external port 5060 to another internal port, such as 80 [I.e. &amp lt externalIP&amp gt :5060 --&amp gt  192.168.1.65:80] for the GUI of the phone system (i know this is a bad idea, and was only for a matter of minutes as part of troubleshooting) does open external port 5060 and the gui will load through an external connection, but forwarding it to internal port 5060 closes the port again and no phones can register using the external IP.      I have tried changing the SIP port the phone system listens on, wondering if there is a block in place on external connections to port 5060 internally. Most recently changed to 200 and forwarding external 5060 to internal 200, and that also does not open the external port 5060.       Additionally, i have tried disabling the router firewall, phone server firewall and both together, none of which had any effect in resolving the issue. Further to this i tried placing the phone server in the DMZ which again had no effect.      The only other idea i have on what could be affecting it is the new BT IP phone service that they are replacing analogue lines with - wondering whether the fact this router now connects to that is interfering with it, but i cant see any options in the router to disable that service.      It really shouldn't be this hard to do a relatively basic task, but i have spent several hours working on this across multiple days, and i am no further forward but starting to loose my mind. Therefore, i and am hoping there is someone in the BT community support who has come across this issue and found a solution that they would be willing to share. Or at least any further troubleshooting steps that i have overlooked.      Many thanks in advance for any assistance that you can provide ",26,Mar,2022,05,b5,OtherBB

It seems that my previous router and package was better in terms of getting consistent speed and connection over Wi-Fi to our bedrooms, than this latest and more expensive package and equipment.      I contacted BT tech agent many times about it and the last one told me that it would be better to use 2.4Hz band and he would close 5Mz band on my router system, remotely. So now I basically end up with the same speed as before my upgrade which is about 50-60Mbs instead of 150Mbs. Is he right in shutting 5Mz band?      The router is placed on my passage, as I thought the signal would travel better to our bedrooms upstairs.

I tried setting a range of IP addresses as IPV4 addresses (I think) and assigning the Google Homes static addresses in that range but that didn't seem to work but   STRONG the setting that seems to have really made a difference is to use Stateful addressing instead of Stateless under IPV6 settings   STRONG . This, I believe, makes the BT Smart Hub assign the IPV6 addresses (like IPV4 DHCP) and forces the Google Homes to accept these addresses.

Surprised by this as we live in a ""4G great outdoors, good indoors"" area according to EE coverage checker, a near neighbour has good EE coverage on mobile, and someone else in the village has Hybrid Connect with no hassles.  Device is in a relatively modern extension, so not likely to be stone construction issues.  I followed the guidance and tried it elsewhere in the house, but no difference.  Rebooted and then Factory reset, again no difference.      Rang BT help and spoke to Hybrid Connect support - at their suggestion I removed and wiped SIM, no change.  After going through options, they decided it was probably a faulty device and sent out a replacement.      But the replacement device made no difference, so again spoke to tech support.  After a fair amount of head scratching, they decided it must be a signal issue (notwithstanding everything above) and have sent out a MIMO aerial to maximise signal.  But still no change.      I'm now at a loss to know where to go from here - our broadband is pretty reliable, and on the the rare occasions it's out we have reasonable amounts of 4G data on mobile contracts to cover, so there's a limit to how far I'm wanting to take this.

I have also got the BT Hybrid Connect 4G modem to fail over to if the fibre line goes down. The 4G modem is connected to the Smart Hub 2 using a LAN port on the Smart Hub 2.      The Hybrid connect works fine and kicks in if the main fibre line fails.      I have a server on my network and I use port forwarding on the Smart Hub 2 to access it externally. However when the network fails over to the 4G hybrid I can no longer access the server. I know that the external IP address changes when it switches to 4G but even knowing the new external IP address and trying to access the server from this new IP address, I cannot.      I thought it might be because the 4G modem might be changing the internal IP address of the server but it doesn't seem to as the IP address remains the same. It's the Smart Hub 2 that still acts as the main router and remains in control of the IP address allocation, I think.      So can anyone think of a reason why the port forwarding might not work when the Hybrid is in use and what I could do to fix it? There doesn't seem to be any way of getting on to the hybrid modem directly to see its settings and so everything seems to have to be managed through the Smart Hub 2 interface.

I have device on my home network that in the future I may want to   STRONG permanently   STRONG  remove internet access from, but keep it available within the internal network.      I have found the section in the MyBT app to ""Control wi-fi access"", (slightly confusing because my device is connected by ethernet cable), and proved that ""Pause wi-fi access"" blocks the device from connecting to the internet as I want. The issue for me at the moment is that it only seems to be possible to block access for up to 24 hours, or for set times each day?      I can see that I can also set a schedule, so is the answer to set it for 7 days a week from 00:00 to 23:59 daily? If so, does that, in theory, mean that it will still be able to connect to the internet for 1 minute each day, (23:59 to midnight)?      Also, does using ""Control wi-fi access"" also mean that the device in question will be invisible to the internet and that no one would be able to access it from outside my internal network?      *The device in question is a Netgear ReadyNAS 214 server that I understand is no longer supported by Netgear, so I'm assuming that whilst it still works perfectly well for our requirements within the home, it has, or soon will, become a security risk leaving it with internet access?

The power light is flashing with about 3.5 sec on and 0.5 sec off.    The data light also flashes briefly every few seconds.

With the home hotspot plugged in the pattern is the same.       On the hotspot, the power light is steady, the wifi appears to be functioning but the wps link light is not consistent  - took some minutes to come on and then internet connection is not reliable even if all three lights steady.       Meanwhile back on the extender the light pattern has changed, power and data are steady but ethernet light is flickering .

Now even the lowest quality material either refuses to play or plays for a few seconds before locking up.      It seems that that the update has greatly reduced the data transfer rate of the USB port. Sometimes (but not always) after a video stalls the drive can no longer be accessed across the network. Removing and replacing it has no effect although inserting another stick is normal (with the same video limitation). The only way to regain network access to an affected stick is to restart the router. I tried a factory reset in case the upgrade corrupted something but the problem remained.

It looks fine from the settings page of the App (nicely cascaded, latest firmware, devices connecting, ...etc...) but the internet connection keeps dropping!      Vodafone have checked, and predictably say it's a BT (Whole Home Premium) issue not theirs - and told me to remove the new 'mesh'.  But, reading on this (and the Vodafone) community I see that this is a 'known issue' - Whole Home doesn't work well with a Vodafone supplied broadband hub whatever the BT adverts say!

And the Netgear D7000 Nighthawk (which is a modem router) might work - but I would then be paying for its WiFi capability which seems daft since Whole Home provides that!!

I checked the firmware and it is up-to-date.      I also called the BT support team and they asked me to plug the new disc into one of the other functioning discs on the ethernet ports.

(I went for these rather than the complete discs as I believed they would give faster speeds).      On the whole these have been working well with very few if any disconnects but my issue is that I run into a raft of issues when I try to airplay from my iPhone to any HomePods or apple tvs. Additionally, when I try to submit a personal request to a HomePod it often responds telling me that my iPhone is not on the same network so it cannot deal with the request.       If I turn off the discs completely and use the smart hub 2, I do not get any of these issues but I am then plagued with poor signal coverage. My assumption would be that the mesh network is not compatible with airplay but I have tried turning off all the discs besides the main one (effectively creating a one router solution) but this did not work either.      This leads me to believe it is a setting on the whole home discs rather than it being a mesh network which is causing the issue but does not appear to be many options or settings on the discs that I can change. I am hesitate to change any settings on the smart hub 2 because this seems to work on its own as above.      Any help would be great!      Thanks      Chris ",08,Feb,2022,11,PaddyB,BTDevices

38,Pro Box WiFi Channel Limitations &amp; Box Unresponsive.,https://community.bt.com/t5/YouView-from-BT/Pro-Box-WiFi-Channel-Limitations-amp-Box-Unresponsive/m-p/2220426#M65505,"Made an interesting &amp amp  annoying discovery about the Pro Box's WiFi reception today as I made some changes to my network. It seems that the Pro Box can only see the basic 5GHz WiFi channels &amp amp  can't see anything above channel 44. This explains why the box couldn't see the SSID of my Fritzbox router on channel 100 when I first installed it. I had incorrectly assumed this was down to weak reception in the box, as it could see my neighbour's SSID, which is closer. But today I proved it was the WiFi channel.      Now the changes I made today were swapping an old Netgear WAC104 access point for a mesh repeater. The Netgear being old was also limited to the basic 5GHz channels, &amp amp  this is what the Pro Box had picked up rather than the stronger signal. The repeater just passed on the channel 100 that the router is set to.      Now the interesting thing is that the Box didn't display any error messages, but just locked up almost immediately after booting. Multiple reboots resulted in the same scenario, box stopped responding within a few seconds of the TV picture appearing. The issue only came to light when I did a maintenance mode factory reset &amp amp  then found that the SSID couldn't be found.      Now I don't know what 5GHz channels the various BT Hubs support as I don't use them, but if any support the higher channels it's possible that auto channel selection could be responsible for some of the reports of boxes suddenly locking up. The Hub selects a channel the Box can't see but the symptom is the box locking rather than a report of a lost connection.          uid=""255971""           uid=""13""             Do we know if this is a hardware limitation of the WiFi card in the Box or something that could be addressed by firmware?      Edit      A Google search found a thread that suggested the SH2 goes up to channel 48. If that is correct &amp amp  my experience of the box being limited to 44 is also accurate, there is indeed the possibility for auto channel selection to hop to a channel the Box can't see.

There is no clear pattern to this, except it generally appears to happen when watching Liverpool play (e.g. last week's League Cup final it dropped twice). sometime this can be fixed by resetting the extenders, sometimes by simply rebooting the box itself, but when it is at its worst, it means resetting the whole box back to factory settings and starting again.

P   Note that I have a 65” TV. Users who are watching on small devices phones tablets etc. may find the quality acceptable.      P          P   BT Sport Expert “DarrenDev” has checked and confirmed that I am receiving the best quality streams for HD (up to 7.3 Mbps) and for UHD (31 Mbps). This should be the case anyway, as I have fast and reliable FTTP broadband (500 Mbps)      P   7.3 Mbps should be easily enough for very good quality HD, but it is not, on BT Sport at least.      P   I think the problem here may simply be the source video quality is simply not very good. Either that, or the video encoders used by BT Sport are very poor, but that seems unlikely to me.      P   But whatever the cause, as a user, the effect is the same. Very poor video quality, that is nowhere near as good as, for example, Sky Sports, where you never see the kind of issues artefacts that I am seeing.      P          P   So, I’d like to know if others are seeing the same kind of issues as I am.      P   To give you an idea of what I’m seeing, I actually filmed some BT Sport video with my iPhone camera of my TV, and also grabbed a couple of stills from it.      P   Obviously doing this encodes the video again, so there is some reduction in quality due to that. However,             what you see here is still a fair reflection on what I’m seeing on my 65”LG             OLED TV. The iPhone hasn’t added significant extra artefacts to the video.      P          P   So:      P   1)      P     A title=""Test image 1"" href=""https:  www.dropbox.com s bh21zoufsuovov9 BT%20Sport%20Image1.jpg?dl=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" Test image 1   A        P   This is an image near the start of the video.

Notice that there is virtually zero detail in the grass.      P   You would never consider this to be a remotely HD image. This is not acceptable quality in my opinion.      P        3)      P     A title=""Original video"" href=""https:  www.dropbox.com s ju5i204gchkhm8i BT%20Sport%20Test.mov?dl=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" Original 9 second video   A            For reference, this is the original video, straight from my iPhone. Download the video before playback, as Dropbox will probably lower the video quality noticeably. The file is only 44MB.      P          P   So, in image 2 above, the quality is terrible. The difference here is that the camera is panning at the time.             It seems that the picture quality degrades terribly whenever there is any camera motion.                  P   Now considering that the HD streams are up to 7.3Mbps, you wouldn’t expect this kind of severe degradation.      P   I’ve seen the same kind of poor video quality on the MotoGP live broadcasts too.      P   On the other hand, the UHD premier league transmissions are absolutely spot-on.      P   I do not see this kind of HD degradation on any other services I use (including Sky, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV).      P   What I would like to know is if other large TV viewers are also seeing this poor quality (in my case I’m viewing via the BT Sport AppleTV app)      P   My suspicion is that the problem here is at the source, i.e. the video stream provided to BT Sport.      P          P   But as a subscriber, I think it is fair to expect much better quality than this.      P          P   Thank you for any help      P          P   Liz ",27,Mar,2022,10,MissLiz,BTSportontheBox

87,"BT - Please, please, please fix the BT Sport Login Keyboard! Let us use the built-in one!",https://community.bt.com/t5/BT-Sport-on-TV-Online-player-or/BT-Please-please-please-fix-the-BT-Sport-Login-Keyboard-Let-us/m-p/2206303#M31202,"Hi,      First to fall, the BT Sport app is fantastic. I have little to complain about other than the following.      The BT proprietry keyboard to log in is quite honestly, awful. I will provide several reasons. This at least applies to the   STRONG Android TV   STRONG  and   STRONG Fire TV   STRONG  apps:      1) For unknown reasons, you cannot use the device built in keyboard. This would enable use of the device's remote keyboard and make it far easier to enter email address and password. It would simply be a case of copy pasting by using the Android TV remote up from a phone for example, or the Fire TV remote app for Fire TV. This makes it extremely convenient to log in, compared to the lengthy process of manually entering each character in the BT keyboard.      2) The keyboard navigation is very slow and the need to have to flick back and fourth to another screen for capital letters is poor.      3) The proprietry BT keyboard only encourages people to use weak passwords, which is a security concern. Example: I use a password manager for most of my things. My BT password was way more than 30 characters, therefore it was  extremely secure. This proprietry keyboard requires the password to be entered manually each time, which only encourages users to enter less secure, shorter passwords for convenience.      4) I use a VPN for other regional content purposes. Sometimes I forget to disconnect the VPN. When this happens, the BT app insists that I have to log in again. Even if I disconnect from the VPN, I still have to log back in again using the ridiculously annoying and pointless proprietry keyboard. So connecting disconnecting from a VPN affectively logs you out of the app entirely.      My email address is quite long and isn't one of the preset ones at the bottom of the keyboard. My password is also quite long, though I had to shorten 30+ characters because it was far too time consuming. I have several Fire TVs and an Android TV device and it seems like I am having to log in to at least one of them on a weekly basis for whatever reason. It is very frustrating and needless, because it could easily be avoided or made significantly quicker. Of all the streaming and other login apps I have, BT Sport is the only one that insists I use their proprietry keyboard, which is almost certainly less secure than the built in one (onwatchers could see you entering your password as you type it in. It encourages users to enter less secure passwords to save time).        U   STRONG Solutions   STRONG    U       Allow users to use the built in relative device keyboard.      Stop the app from logging out each time you connect disconnect from a VPN      Ability to use a QR code and scan with a logged in mobile device.      Log in to a website and enter a generated, unique code. This is how pretty much ever other streaming app does it including Netflix, Amazon, BBC iPlayer etc.      Thank you!

So In total 3 devices at one time. However since I moved out I’m fully aware I cannot bring the pro box to another house I have been using the bt tv app to view the football am I correct in thinking the bt tv app acts as a substitute for the pro box.  So can I view the football from the bt tv app and they  continue to use the bt sports app? So 1 stream on bt tv app and 2 stream on bt sport app?                 Is the ultimate channel the only thing I would not receive using bt tv app and are the other channels still 1080p 50fps.                      giving them control of the pro box is not really a viable option as they are often on the move with work and stream slot of the games outside the house.

Why launch a new box (Pro) and then pull popular channels from the lineup? UKTV are replying on their own social media that it was a BT decision not to carry their content. That being the case, can customers not feed their feelings about this back to BT?

You've now got subtitles on the phone's little screen, but you want it on the big screen, so..      2) go onto Ebay and get a Chromecast device (I got a 3rd gen unit for £22, 2nd hand. Good enough for me, but if you want 4K UHD then you'll need the latest version). Its about the size of a computer mouse.      3) attach the Chromecast to a spare HDMI port on your TV. If (like me) you haven't got a spare port, then you can just disconnect the cable from the BT TV set-top box as you can't watch 2 things at once.

I know that not many people use them these days but can be a lifesaver.           e.g, if you are out and about at night and lost your phone and need to call a taxi. And can quite literally be a lifesaver as a friend of mine fell in the country while out and about, a nasty fall and was unconscious on the middle of the road, and the friend he was with didn't have a mobile (they had left them behind), luckily as it was a quiet country road, there weren't many cars around at 11 pm, but unluckily, there were no houses for miles. Fortunately, there was a payphone nearby, so the emergency services could be contacted and family could be contacted.             Will these be connected at some emergency exchange or removed altogether? I  may remember wrong, but I think I read somewhere that it was law to have s a certain number of them operational in the UK as they are a mandatory service. ",20,Mar,2022,23,smyth492,Faults

22,Can  you port a number from a cancelled BT landline?,https://community.bt.com/t5/Home-phone-including-Digital/Can-you-port-a-number-from-a-cancelled-BT-landline/m-p/2221872#M83043,"Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I have read so much contradictory information.             My situation is that I had a BT landline set up when I moved into my current address long ago.  So my number is the one originally issued by BT and for which I am paying them for line rental and phone service.      I also have an ADSL internet service on this line which provided by another operator.      I now want to move to a third company to take over my line rental and provide an FTTC internet service.      Like many people I no longer use my landline, however because I have an elderly parent who sometimes uses it, I would like to retain access to my number.  So I want to transfer it to a cheap or free VOIP service to keep the number only for very occasional use.  (And I accept the consequences of VOIP not working in a power cut etc.)             The problem is that if I port my telephone number it will cancel my BT service, and with it lose access to my internet service.  But if I migrate my internet service that will also cancel my BT service, and with it my landline.      While the former option (switch phone service then order new internet) is straight forward, it is more important to maintain my internet service.  However I am willing to lose access to my phone number for a short period.      This feels like it would be a reasonably common situation, however no one seems to want to support it.  I guess the landline providers like BT do not want to make it too easy to leave them, the new line rental providers want you to also take their telephone services, and VOIP providers seem more interested in business customers then it to be worth their effort.             So my questions are, if I transfer my line to the new internet provide and my BT service is cancelled, would I still be able to port my cancelled BT telephone number afterwards?  And if so if there anything extra I need to know or do, or is the process the same?  Or would this risk me losing my telephone number completely?      If not, is there any better option than losing internet access for a few weeks?      Though I can also move my phone service to the new internet provider, so everything gets done in one operation, the minimum contract term means I would then have to pay them for a phone service for a year before being able to cancel.  And I am not sure whether porting the number from them would be complicated by it being a BT issued number?  Is that  my only realistic option?

I did try calling the Helpline, but they were not much help!      Hopefully, the good people on these forums will be able to answer my questions.      I currently have FTTC which syncs at the maximum 80 20 of my contract and a SmartHub 2. The only telephone plugged in to the landline is a combined one with handset keypad, and is also the base station for 4 DECT cordless instruments. Plugged in to an extension socket is the dialler for our home alarm - this uses standard DTMF tones, calls our mobiles if the alarm is triggered and plays a pre-recorded announcement. During that call from the alarm, we can also disable the alarm via the mobile's keypad.      The master phone socket, (type 5C), is in the lounge with the SH2 and I have extension wiring to the telephone in the hall and to the alarm dialler.        U   STRONG Questions:   STRONG    U       1.) Currently, my SH2 webpage says the telephone is ""Not Configured"". Will BT remotely do this at the appropriate time, or will I have to do it?      2.) My understanding is that the SH2 is effectively a DECT compatible cordless phone base station, so I should just be able to unpair my 4 DECT handsets from the current base station and re-pair them to the SH2 instead? If this is correct, what is the maximum number of DECT handsets that the SH2 can support?      3.) Ideally, I would like to keep my existing internal cabling. I can see that BT sell Digital Voice Adapters, which appear to be DECT to wired phone converters (?) - by my preference is for wired on everything, telephones, ethernet etc   span class=""lia-unicode-emoji"" title="":slightly_smiling_face:"" 🙂   span . I thought that I had read on these forums some time ago that a replacement Master Socket 5C faceplate was available that could be swapped for the existing one, and together with a cable plugged in to this new faceplate and the SH2's phone socket, enabled all of the existing home phone cabling to be connected to the Digital Voice service? Unfortunately, the Digital Voice Helpline didn't seem to know anything about his - so did I imagine that? If it does exist, is it something that I can install myself? (Technically I am quite happy to  -but am I allowed to?   span class=""lia-unicode-emoji"" title="":winking_face:"" 😉   span  ).      4.) I have been advised that my alarm dialler   EM might   EM  no longer work  -what problems can I expect?      I am aware that because calls will now go via the broadband, a power cut will mean loss of landline telephone in future. Whilst we are not particularly prone to power cuts in our area, I am thinking about buying a UPS to back up the SH2:      5.) What is the maximum power consumption of the SH2, (I need to make sure that the UPS that I buy can power it!).      6.) I believe that the Openreach fibre cabinets have back-up batteries inside them? How long are they intended to power the cabinet for? (No point in me getting a UPS that will keep my SH2 running significantly longer than the cabinet will last!).      7.) At some point in the future, I will probably move from our current FTTC to FTTP. How much power does the fibre ONT consume? (Might as well factor that in to UPS size now).      Any recommendations for a suitable UPS please?      A lot of questions - but hopefully I will be a lot clearer on what this change means for me   span class=""lia-unicode-emoji"" title="":grinning_face:"" 😀   span       TIA ",19,Mar,2022,09,Paul608085,Faults

But I have a few questions regarding the service.           1. I noticed is that now when dialling another landline, you have to include the full area code. (E.g. if I wanted to call my neighbour, usually I would dial 9076 8***. But now from the landline I have to Dial 028 9076 8***) Is this a permanent fixture? Is this a temporary fixture that may be improved and amended over time?                      2. There seems to be about a 1 or 2 second delay when you lift the receiver before you revive a dial tone. Again, is this something that will improve and get quicker over time, or is this permanent. I know in the early days of telephones there used to be a delay before receiving dial tone.                      3. Before on copper, I believe you were allocated an exchange and given a number from there. Are exchanges going away? If so, will that make it easier to choose the telephone number that you want in the future?                             there, I didn’t break into a rant.

We have recently switched broadband providers to BT and as a result our landline phone has also moved over to Digital Voice.      We live in an L-shaped property, and the BT smart hub has been installed in what I’ll refer to as the main house. An elderly person lives in the other part (let’s call it the annexe). This person is the only member of the household who uses the landline phone.      The shape of the house and thick stone walls mean that any WiFi network only covers the part of the L-shape which holds the router (in this case, the main house) but we have always got around this by setting up an old router as a network repeater and connecting this to the primary router via a long LAN cable and placing this secondary router in the annexe.      When I explained the situation, BT kindly provided us with a Digital Voice phone. I (and the customer service operator) mistakenly believed that all that was needed for the phone to work was a working WiFi connection - even if this came via the secondary router. We have now found that the phone barely works since it is trying to connect to the Smart Hub in the main house rather than to the hub in the annexe.                 having spoken to BT again, they have now sent out a Digital Voice adapter to try and get a better signal in the annexe. I’m less than hopeful about this solution, since in order to be of use, this would need to be placed in the annexe, but wherever we place it, it will barely get a signal from the Smart Hub. My feeling is that if the special DV phones cannot get adequate reception, then the same will surely apply to the Adapter.      any solution that relies on wireless connection between the two halves of the house will be problematic in any event. Powerline adapters are also useless (I assume) since the two parts of the house are on separate circuits.       ideally I would like to stick with a wired solution. I don’t know whether I would be able to get a second BT Smart Hub and use that as our secondary router? If so would the DV phone still be able to register to that hub, after I have switched off the DHCP server and changed the IP address on the second Smart Hub?      or is our only solution BT complete (which - for all its expense - I have little faith in since again I feel it would rely on being able to transmit a wireless signal through our very thick walls)      I’m hoping that someone who has a better understanding of the technicalities may be able to offer a solution… ",02,Mar,2022,10,DKA,Faults

I took advantage of the upcoming price rise to cancel my BT handset plan a little early penalty free resulting in a nice saving, £100 or so. Thumbs up.

Not a problem, there is an option to correct it, except they insist on texting a one off pin as a security measure before I could change it.

My home is in an area where the mobile phone signal is very poor on all networks, so WiFi calling is crucial. I have recently moved 2 phones - mine and my wife's - from Vodafone to BT Mobile. So far my Samsung Galaxy S10 seems to be handling WiFi Calling okay, but my wife's iPhone 8 Plus is very unreliable, with frequent connection failures and dropped calls.      We have fibre broadband via a BT Home Hub 5 with download over 30Mbps, upload of 6Mbps and latency of 23ms. This should be easily adequate for WiFi Calling.      We have tried using the iPhone in airline mode, to avoid the potential issue with the phone trying to switch between mobile network and WiFi during calls.      With the iPhone in the same room as the Home Hub (so that the WiFi signal strength is definitely not an issue), and showing WiFi Calling active, the following issues are experienced with the iPhone:      1) Outgoing calls do not connect. No ringing is heard and ""Call Failed"" is shown on the screen.      2) When the iPhone is an in a state of not allowing outgoing calls, any callers to the iPhone are told that it is not accepting calls.      3) Active calls are disconnected at random intervals. Sometimes it is possible to re-establish the call immediately, sometimes the iPhone is in a state where issues 1 and 2 are present.      Could there be something wrong with the settings on the iPhone? It is fully up-to-date.      Could it be that the Home Hub 5 cannot properly handle WiFi Calling from an iPhone? Do BT need to provide a more modern router?      I am really disappointed with BT overall. BT Mobile are not providing me with a usable signal at my home (contrary to what their network coverage site indicates), nor are they providing a reliable WiFi Calling solution for the iPhone via a BT broadband connection.

From the middle of last week he has begun to experience frequent and extensive issues both receiving and sending messages via outlook and other desktop ipad applications which use SMTP and IMAP for message sending and receiving. He's logged quite a few support  calls, performed password resets, confirmed the correct settings (only using SSL AND using the correct ports  (as per   A href=""https:  www.bt.com help email manage-email-account manual-settings what-are-the-settings-for-outgoing-and-incoming-bt-email-servers"" target=""_blank"" https:  www.bt.com help email manage-email-account manual-settings what-are-the-settings-for-outgoing-and-incoming-bt-email-servers   A ). However it still is not working correctly. It seems to come in fits and starts. While i was assisting him last week (and on the phone to BT support) the queued smtp outgoing messages on his machine suddenly began sending and then 60 seconds later stopped again. SMTP appears to be the worst affected service with the credentials being rejected by the SMTP server as incorrect username or password, even though they worked before without issue. Same applies to IMAP access although the authentication for this appears to be a little more stable with incoming messages appearing periodically. As an IT specialist in both infrastructure and systems (VMWARE certified, MS Certified, Dell Certified Engineer) this all points towards issues with the back-end authentication framework. It seems that whatever authentication source is being used for these services it's not getting the credential updates or not handling them  in the correct manner. Yes access works fine from the BT APP or BT WEB UI but my guess is this does not use IMAP SMTP for message transfer. He and I have gone around the houses on this for days with zero progress. I've told him it's probably a platform update issue and that some component in the auth chain which has been patched is probably misbehaving and causing the problem. I just wish someone from BT would take note of the issues and sort it out! Hence my post on here to try and ascertain if others have seen stability authentication issues on the IMAP SMTP  gateways of late.       There is clearly an issue as far as I can see but nobody within tech support seems to be able to do anything. I even asked to speak to a manager to no avail.... I'm at the point of migrating his email onto google which at least uses modern security protocols (not just plain SSL - come on BT!) and additional measures to secure the link. At least it's stable!             Any advice or feedback appreciated.              thanks      Adam. ",13,Mar,2022,11,mdbuk,Email

When I opened BT webmail today I did get a popup video saying my account had been moved to a new something but I don't understand why the BT browser webmail is NOT showing the older content (that is obviously there as its still showing on google mail app) and all of them are set as IMAP (don't use pop3 so not a local storage issue).          The accounts were originally BT Yahoo hosted and moved to BT Mail a couple of years ago when you updated mail host. There have been no recent changes or notification emails and its not an outlook issue as your webmail link is also missing content.          Any advice ?

This seemed to work until February this year when it decided to leave a handful of emails in Spam - including some which are normally let through and including one from BT that was forwarded to me from my partner!      I then bolstered the rule by adding the full stop character to the list it looks for. My partner then resent the email from BT as a test and the rule ignored it again!

Despite actually reporting this to several members of the support team none of them appeared to do anything to fix it.      Finally, I was lucky enough to speak to someone who almost instantly understood what was wrong and he got things fixed for me and I was finally able to use Digital Voice.      It appeared that in transferring me from the old system to the new Digital Voice they had put in place a redirection which should have been removed when the Digital Voice went live.      The man that I spoke with said he was able to work this out quickly due to the fact that he has practical experience on fixing phones and was aware of the uses of redirects etc. It appears that most of the call centre staff I came in contact with didn't have this experience knowledge.      I said I expected compensation for not being able to use my Digital Voice service which BT where still charging me for.      We agreed on a figure that I would get back, I won't mention it here, and he said that would close my complaint, trouble is the person responsible for signing off on this does not appear to have done so. This was a month ago.      A condition of getting this money back seemed to be that I don't report this to Ofcom but I am getting close to doing so and still, would expect the compensation as they billed me for something they have not supplied me.

I Went through loads of troubles calling BT literally single other work day between lunch breaks or after meetings, I spoke with different engineers trying me to do same thing over and over again but the result stayed the same. An Engineer finally attended unannounced on the 1st December around 10:40am and rectified the issue within 10 minutes.      Now only 3 months later I get a text message on Thursday the 3rd March (see attached). ""Another customer is trying to take over your line...""  I called BT 20 mins later after I received the text and spoke to customer services who mentioned it's probably someone else moved into the building and got the wrong apartment number. I was put on hold while she cancelled the request and told me I will receive a confirmation of cancellation. On the following day Friday 4th March I get a similar automated text message. (Please see attached). I replied on the automated text TWICE confirming not to cancel the line. NO that's its not right and then NOT MOVING to let them know I am not moving and not requested for anyone to cancel the line.      So after confirming not to cancel my broadband 3 times. Twice replying to automated text and once over the phone to speaking to customer service. Today I get home from work early to finish off some work for a project and my broadband has now been ceased. I have got projects to complete and the days I planned to work over time and from home they have cancelled the broadband.

The agent who chatted with me, told me the service would be activated on the 7th of March. Shortly, this was delayed to the 14th of March. On the 14th of March, this was delayed to the 17th of March. On the 17th of March, this was delayed to the 21st of March. On each of these occasions, I was asked by email a day before the activation date: ""are you ready?""                Finally, on the 21st (after the 'are you ready' email on the 20th), I received a message that my service is 'up and running.' It's neither up nor running. I still see the same flashing purple light on my Smart Hub 2. Clearly, the engineer who made the connections did not check if everything was in order? I find it hard to fathom why.                 Furthermore, as the order was being delayed, I had made a call to BT and was told that the people at OpenReach were aware of a fault in the line, and would be sending the appropriate engineers to fix it and activate the connection. I find it hard to fathom why that was not done.                In the meanwhile, I also placed a complaint for a delayed order. I got a delayed response to that. The agent who called me, on the 21st, told me the service should be activated by midnight. It was not.                  I have made multiple calls to BT since this morning. I have now been told that an engineer will visit on Thursday (and that I should be available at home) to fix the fault. I don't think that's going to happen either.

On 25th December 2021 I tried to setup the BTSport benefit with no luck, I gave up because I had joy previously setting up the Amazon Prime Smart Benefit on numerous occasions.      So on the 20th January 2022 I contacted EE live chat for help (frankly this seems to be when things have become worse)      Chat support tried 3 times to get it to work asking me for a BT Pin number via email without any joy, I was told that a complain had been raised with EE and they would be in touch within 24 hours, 30 minutes later I received a text from EE stating the complaint had been closed. Nothing was resolved?       I've come to understand the issue I'm having with the BT Smart benefit is that I'm not getting the confirmation email from BT to confirm the account, so although I'm getting a BT Sports ID, I didn't receive the confirmation email which means the account hasn't been actually created.      So I try signing up again with a different email address, same issue again, no confirmation email arrives to confirm the account.      So February arrives and I get a notification that a telecoms account has been added to my account, its BT with a debt of £196!!!!       Is this normal? This is supposed to be a seemless addition of my EE package, not another account debt added to my credit score?? I can see from the account number that this is from the BT Sports Smart benefit I tried to add on the 25th Decemeber, but this account doesn't exist!       It gets worse       Today I get another notification from my credit score telling me another telecom account has been added to my account (I'm assuming this is my 2nd attempt at signing up for BT Sport Smart benefit) and its even worse this time because I don't even know the BT account number for this because I didn't receive any confirmation email or email confirming anything!      So now I've got (2) BT debts attached to my credit score and I don't have even 1 working EE Smart benefit.      If anyone can offer any info on how or why this has happened and how I can get this resolved I'd really appreciate       I'd really like to get this resolved today if possible, I know how a credit rating works, what I don't understand is how through a EE Smart benefit which is supposed to be a feature of my contract with EE, I've got 2 debts on my credit report now from BT.

We placed an order for BT Broadband on 14th March. We were told that our installation date was booked for 1st March. There were no ""ands, ifs or buts"" and no mention at any time that date is subject to change, so we believed 1st March was our guaranteed install date. So we proceeded to cancel our contract with our then current ISP, who have recently cut our internet 1 month after cancellation.      Due to this, we are now using BTs 4G Mini Hub thing for basic browsing, but I cannot upload my videos to YouTube (so I can't do my job and earn money) and we cannot entertain ourselves with Netflix, Disney+ etc as the 4G Mini Hub doesn't seem up to the job.      We had an engineer come out on 5th March. After this happened, our NEW installation date was increased to 24th March! This was unacceptable, so I raised a complaint that took BT 10-14 days to review. They did try to call us, but my father was unable to take the call as he was working. He's trying to call them back today.      However, out of the blue and seemingly at random, our installation date has been pushed back AGAIN. This time to 28th March!! WHY? Because I complained?? They seem to be OK with leaving us with basic internet for nearly a month? Why did they change the date to even further in the future??      I have to say, from a new customers point-of-view, this is terrible service and a terrible experience. This is our first change to a new ISP in nearly 2 decades, our FIRST change over, and it's a bad experience.

82,Messed up order,https://community.bt.com/t5/Bills-Packages/Messed-up-order/m-p/2219990#M143116,"HR     Hi,      I set up a home move from BT and should've transferred over on February 7th. I'm not entirely sure what the problem was but after sorting a problem out in the cabinet I was finally connected at my new address on around the 25th February. After being connected I noticed I noticed on my account that my new connection date was on the 2nd of March for my old address. I could see what was going to happen, that my connection at my new address would be switched off and reconnected at my old address. I called BT to tell them this and was told this wouldn't happen. Low and behold my connection switched off at my new address on the 2nd and reconnected at my old address. I've now been told they have to cancel my order and do a brand new one but Openreach aren't allowing them to do this. I've never dealt with such incompetence. Does anyone have any ideas how to solve this? Thanks ",08,Mar,2022,22,Cooptaxx,Billqueries

But having just checked, it says that the order was cancelled as requested by me. I did not cancel it at all and no one has contacted me to confirm why it was cancelled.

We moved sometime ago to a new provider (as part of purchasing a new phone system), taking over the lines was part of the deal (wish I hadn't said yes).      To cut a long story short the new telco went to the wall leaving Siemens being owned money for the equipment and Gamma Communication (who the bust telco used as their provider) being owned money for the line rental.      I contacted Gamma directly who did their best to help (in the constraints of GDPR and data protection), however they said as the number had been ceased it had been returned to range holder (which would be BT Openreach). I've spoken to someone who says they have checked the WLR portal and the number still hasn't been returned to there, it was disconnected mid April last year. They say the number may still be in Quarantine but they can't be sure. As BT is the range holder are you able to provide any additional information, i.e. is it indeed in quarantine or maybe it's still with Gamma and they have got it wrong.      Any help you can provide would be most helpful, I can then chase the right company, it's so difficult to work out who has the disconnected number   span class=""lia-unicode-emoji"" title="":disappointed_face:"" 😞   span       Happy to provide all the details you might need on a private message etc.      Thanks in advance, Dave.

Refund was refused stating BT never told us they were taking over the line , they must have put another one in leaving ours connected.???      i have been distraught beyond explanation dealing with sky.

I spoke to 150, was told that I must have Halo3 at an increased price.      Having stressed that I did not need £80 worth of technical support I would not use, I reached a deal with the agent. As the new deal was after March 1, it was agreed that I would not have to pay the 9.3% increase in April. So far so good.      A couple of days later I checked on MY BT - the agreed price was shown, but it still said I was 'Out of contract'. I was concerned that if I did nothing I would be hit with the % increase. The order was shown as complete.      So I phoned 150 again and, after some time, I was told I had been missold  the package, which is why the 'system' had rejected it. I again explained that I was not interested in paying for Technical Support I would not use. After clearing things with the manager, eventually it was agreed that the original deal would be honoured  - a pdf for was sent to me which I accepted.      However my account remains in the same state - I am shown as out of contract and no order is shown following my latest conversation.      To compound all this my Line Rental Saver is due for renewal and if I try to do this online my Broadband cost is shown as double the amount I have agreed. I rang to query this and was told to renew anyway and not to worry that the amount was wrong - I didn't do this!!.      I have now spent over 3 hours on trying to renew my contract - its almost as if BT don't want my business.      I am at a loss as to what to do next.

I placed the order in November, and I currently know that there is a problem with wayleaves. I have chased the Full fibre team on 150 a weekly basis but I keep getting told different stories about where the holdup lies ie Openreach or 3rd party contractor.      To make matters worse BT decided last Tuesday to cease my existing FTTC service and I'm being told by BT faults that the service cannot be restored !!  . If the service cannot be restored then urgency should be given to the new provision.

So I tried to escalate this ongoing wayleave problem via 150 . Girl refused and told me I must wait for the next update on 9 March, she then cut me off. What wonderful customer service.!      In addition I had already got the Broadband Fault department to issue (3 March) on my behalf a customer complaint and the agent promised to call be back the next day (Friday). Nothing again today Monday so I'm still waiting for a progress report.
