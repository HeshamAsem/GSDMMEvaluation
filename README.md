# GSDMM Evaluation

This repository provides an implementation of the Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Mixture Model (GSDMM) and tools for evaluating its performance. The GSDMM algorithm is designed to identify clusters in short texts, such as tweets or forum posts.

## Features

- **GSDMM Implementation**: Core algorithm to perform clustering on short text data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to evaluate the clustering performance using various metrics.
- **Preprocessing Utilities**: Functions to preprocess text data before clustering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python 3.7+ and the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- tqdm

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk tqdm
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeshamAsem/GSDMMEvaluation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GSDMMEvaluation
```

3. Install the FastText library

```bash
!pip install fasttext
```


4. Install the GSDMM Package

```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/rwalk/gsdmm.git
```


### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset as a CSV file with a column for text data. An example dataset is provided in the `data` directory.

2. **Running the GSDMM Algorithm**:

```python
from gsdmm import MovieGroupProcess

# Example data
texts = ["text1", "text2", "text3"]

# Preprocess texts (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.)
# ...

# Initialize the GSDMM model
mgp = MovieGroupProcess(K=10, alpha=0.1, beta=0.1, n_iters=30)

# Fit the model to the texts
vocab = set(word for text in texts for word in text)
n_terms = len(vocab)
doc_term_matrix = [[text.count(word) for word in vocab] for text in texts]

y = mgp.fit(doc_term_matrix, n_terms)
```

3. **Evaluating the Clustering Performance**:

```python
from evaluation import evaluate

# Evaluate the clustering result
metrics = evaluate(true_labels, predicted_labels)
print(metrics)
```


### FastText Library

The GSDMM Evaluation repository utilizes the FastText library to generate word embeddings, which are essential for capturing semantic similarities between words in our text clustering tasks. FastText, developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) lab, is a library designed for efficient learning of word representations and text classification.

Features of FastText

- **Subword Information**: FastText considers subword information, which allows it to generate embeddings for rare and out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into n-grams.
- **Efficiency**: It is highly efficient in terms of both speed and memory usage, making it suitable for large datasets and real-time applications.
- **Pre-trained Models**: FastText offers pre-trained word vectors for 157 languages, which can be fine-tuned on specific tasks.

- [FastText Documentation](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/support.html)
- [Pre-trained FastText Models](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html)

Using FastText enhances the GSDMM Evaluation project by providing robust and efficient word embeddings, crucial for high-quality text clustering.
